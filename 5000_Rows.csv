One of the Nikons did a fair job of capturing green and other than red side blue shades and the other did a fair job of capturing non bluish red shades through yellows. The Olympus sometimes was pretty good at capturing both ends of the color spectrum but was terrible in the problem range. In desperation I mounted paint color chips in the problem range on a piece of cardboard and my wife and I went to a Best Buy where a wide range of working digital cameras were on display and viewed the test board with each one. Some may have had color adjustments that we didn't try but without adjustment none seemed any better than our existing cameras and some were worse. In desperation I got my old Pentax K-1000 film camera out of storage and took pictures of the test card with it using Fujifilm 200 in various lighting conditions. The photos resulting, after rather expensive processing, were disappointing because all the colors seemed rather drab and the ones in the problem shades were not all that great.<br /><br />I had pretty much given up on capturing colors in the problem range when I came across a posting on line by a women who was having problems capturing the color of purple flowers but claimed that a friend, using a Sony F828 was able to capture and email photos with proper colors of purple flowers so Sony, having discontinued making them, we bought a used one.<br />Being winter, we have not been able to give the camera an extensive test photographing flowers but the shots of our test swatches and of a full range of Crayola Crayons has been impressive. The camera captured the problem colors on the test card pretty well and we could tweak individual colors by adjusting the color balance but it should be noted that adjusting for an individual color can throw other colors off a bit. In addition to capturing colors in the problem range pretty well, all 24 colors in photos, particularly those in the blue side red through purple range, of the Crayola crayons looked good.<br /><br />Some people will no doubt not appreciate the fact that the camera is big, heavy and cumbersome. Its definitely not one that can be slipped into a pocket or purse but it looks like it will do what we want.<br /><br />Charles Leach",12/23/2014

This camera was the top of the line Cybershot when it came out on the market. It has a 4-color Super HAD CCD. The 4th color is emerald green.  The F828 does things that no other camera can do.  It can focus on the side of a basketball in total darkness using red lasers.  You can program it to search in Night Vision and then take the photo with the flash in normal program or auto in silent mode. The camera will switch automatically.  You will never take a out of focus photo.  The red laser beams freak some people out.  It looks like you are going to fire a gun at them. My wife and I both used these cameras for years. You only need to charge it one time for your vacation.  It uses the same battery as the video cameras a InfoLithium M, so it last a super long time. This camera is made to hold by the Carl Zeiss Lenses and then tilt the eyepiece and viewing screen up.  This is one of the best cameras every made. Sony has a new model, but you can love the F828.  Try to focus in total darkness with your new camera?  Sony needs to just remake the F828 with a CMOS sensor.",5/5/2015

It still takes rather decent pictures when there is enough light. Reverse mounting a 50mm lens on the end makes for some interesting macro photos. I've made it through 100,000 actuations with mine so I have a fair idea what I'm talking about.<br /><br />But here's the kicker: Your cell phone likely takes better pictures and videos than this now. The video mode in this camera is terrible by todays standards, it's extremely noisy and only 640x480. Don't expect to shoot in RAW mode it's too slow and encrypted. Autofocus is terrible by today's standards manual focus is electronic and difficult to operate.

While it isn't the fastest, or obviously not the newest or feature packed camera on the market, it is still one of my favorite cameras of all time.  It would be awesome if Sony would bring this back into their line with the upgraded features and technology of today.  The sensor they used back when this camera was produced required a lot of light.  Without a lot of light, you get really grainy images.  Other than the fact that this is old technology, maximum of 8MP, it has been a very stable camera and has never failed me.<br /><br />The neatest features includes night shot and night framing.  Night shot allows shooting video or stills in no light.  The camera emits an infrared ray light that allows for image capture.  It does produce a &#34;green&#34; image similar to b/w only with a heavy green overall tint.<br /><br />Night Framing allows for focusing in total darkness and then shoot still image with flash.<br /><br />Check out their A7S @ iso 409,600! While in another ball park cost wise, I saw a video made with this camera that made night look like dawn!<br /><br />I write reviews because I want to help other people make decisions.

This is a great camera and still takes excellent shots outdoors. The lens is an extremely flexible and bright F2.0 to F2.8, 28mm to 200mm even better than  the RX10 which is F2.8 max aperture. Indoors in dim light the picture is a bit grainy when push to higher ISO, but still acceptable. I think the RX10 is the only fixed lens camera that has a lens that is comparable to the F828. When it is time to upgrade, I will switch to the RX10. For now, the F828 is still a dependable workhorse that churns out excellent photographs.<br /><br />To the previous reviewer, to compare this to a cell phone camera is a real disgrace. I have the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 with a 13Megapixel camera, the picture can not hold a candle to the F828. Factoring the 7x Zoom, the F828 is a truly versatile camera.<br /><br />However, don't ever use this camera for video. It is terrible and SD only.<br /><br />Overall, 5 stars for reliable operation, longevity and aging gracefully!",2/1/2014

The thick foam block is just slightly larger than the loupes case in depth (\\""top to bottom\\"") and transverse (\\""side-to-side\\"") width; I did not trim it in these dimensions, because slightly overstuffing the case prevents the foam from dislodging (I also used a couple drops of glue). The foam is easily trimmed with a #10 scalpel blade to fit the front-to-back dimension (that is, from the hinged \\""back\\"" of the case to the \\""front\\"" with the clasp).  The eggcrate-shaped foam sheet can then be trimmed to fit in the lid of the case.  I did not use the third, flat sheet of foam.

At first I thought that was the case but somehow in all of my go pro accessories some backs are wider than the camera case. In fact I have the extended battery on the back and it took a while to go through my inventory to find one that fit. I only have one GoPro but have amassed 16 separate backs not counting the two that came with this case. Have a skeletal housing that uses no back at all and the LCD Touch screen.

When I received it I was immediately very displease.  Here are the major issues, all of which have been noted by other reviewers:<br /><br />First, the black coloring is much more reflective then the picture suggests.  The surface still reflects a fair amount of light and the actual black color is more of a semi-gloss than a matt.<br /><br />Second - the rear back door is NOT removable.  I have no idea why GoPro decided to modify the design of an otherwise great idea.  So none of your rear doors fit this housing, which further greatly limits its usefulness.<br /><br />Lastly - the lens is a permanent part of this housing and cannot be replaces.  With the cost of a lens replacements kit much lower than the cost of a new housing, it's been much more cost effective to switch out the lens in the past.  But with this housing, one decent scratch on the lens spells doom for this housing.<br /><br />I think GoPro had a solid idea, but for whatever reason that designed this so poorly and deviated from a previously great design that they actually doomed this housing.<br /><br />Save your money....",6/21/2014

What kind of &#34;special ops filming&#34; can one do in the less than 45min life of a battery charge?  Not much!  With a little bit of ingenuity I made a low profile kit for my Hero3+ that gives me 6 hours of video at one sitting.  I'm limited to 6hours because the raw video is so large and the camera will not recognize a 128gB SD card.  The external battery will charge the camera for 12+ hours.

The black housing case is really the way to go in all situations, concerts, dashboard filming, chest mounting, photo journalism, you name it!

I did need to get an adapter to fit my tripod and monopod, since the Pergear has 3/8&#34; female and my tripod and monopod both have 1/4&#34;.  I didn't get my adapter at amazon, but I think they offer them with the Pergear, to make things easier.  The ball swivel is very smooth and I haven't had any trouble tightening it up at any angle.

Of course different ballheads will support different equipment weight, so you do need to choose a model designed for your setup.  In my case I'm using a Canon 70D with a variety of Canon, Tamron and Sigma lenses, no combination of which comes close to the Pergear's maximum 8kg weight specification.<br /><br />The problem with this ballhead is immediately apparent when you first mount and try adjusting the camera.  When you want to adjust the camera position your choice is to loosen the main knob to the point that the camera is completely loose, or leave some tension on the main knob and wind up with gritty, jerky camera movement.  Perhaps this can be forgiven in a ball head costing only $30.  However, the fatal flaw is that when you try to tighten the main knob the entire ball flexes in the base causing the camera to change position, spoiling your composition.  Once tightened, as soon as you release the camera the ballhead allows it to droop slightly.  The result is you have to play a guessing game with camera position, aiming the camera higher than desired and hoping it falls into the desired position after tightening the knob and releasing the camera.<br /><br />I've tried other inexpensive ballheads with similar results and was beginning to think this was a problem inherent to this kind of mount.  But I tried a more expensive, name-brand ballhead and was absolutely stunned at how silky smooth it operated, even with tension on the ball, and how rock-solid it clamped the camera in position.<br /><br />Needless to say I returned the Pergear ballhead and kept the name-brand unit, which only cost $60.<br /><br />Perhaps there are ballheads in the $30-40 price range that are good.  But this Pergear and a few others I tried in this price range were a waste of time and money.",3/16/2015

In most situations the rotation can be compensated for by taking it into account during the initial framing, However, using that technique is too difficult when shooting astronomical objects in the dark at the very inconvenient angles which often occur when shooting the sky. For astronomical shooting I'd give it only 2 stars.<br />I do not recommend this ball head for the Bad and Ugly reasons above, but give it 3 stars because it is a usable product.",2/28/2015

I purchased this to use on a high quality tripod that is about 15 years old.  This tripod was manufactured before the quick release interfaces and ball joints became standard equipment. I need it in time for a photo workshop and it did arrive on time.  Unfortunately the screw on my tripod which connects to the camera was too small for the receiving threads on the device. I had to purchase adapters but they would not have arrived on time.  So, I set up a return for this device.  I subsequently was able to find the adapter in a local camera store (a dying breed of retailer) and it did the trick.  So I canceled the return and I'm perfectly pleased with this now.<br /><br />The adapter you will need for this device is a 1/4&#34; female to 3/8&#34; male.  The 3/8 screws into the hole on the bottom of the tripod mount, and if you buy one with the correct depth, it will fit flush with the base plate.  The 1/4&#34; female receives the 1/4&#34; screw on your existing tripod.  The result is a seamless, gap free installation between the tripod and the Pergear head.<br /><br />Note: The quick release plate on top has a 1/4&#34; screw which is perfect for your camera.  For the life of me, I can't understand why this is not consistent.  A professional photographer that I spoke with suggested that this could be a difference between European and American sizing, but the more I think about that, it doesn't make sense since the European would be Metric and American ASA.<br /><br />The reason for the four stars instead of five is simply because of the hassle I had to go through.  The seller should be providing that adapter with the tripod head.  The adapter that I purchased from a local camera store was only $3.  Amazon sells a set of these adapters of different depths.  You will need the smallest one, not the entire set of five graduated reducer bushings.",6/8/2015

One would think to lock or open rotate in the direction of  the arrow, but it's the opposite, the dot signifies the position. Line the dot on the rotating part with the dot on the fixed part and that is the position. What I do is to set the adapter to open, mount the lens (red dot to dot on non moving portion of adapter) then line up the lock dot to the dot on the non moving part and then mount on camera. Sounds a bit complicated but it isn't.  Once you get the hang of it  there are no problems. If you can't adjust the aperture manually on the lens, then it isn't in the adapter correctly.  It's cheap enough that I may buy several and just leave them on the FD lens to speed things up.",4/22/2014

Flange distance is critical with wide angle lenses as they have very shallow depth of field behind the lens. I'm trying to switch over completely to FD glass and I want an adapter on each lens so that it's easier to change lenses. I bought 4 Chinese adapters off ebay to begin with. They would not focus to infinity with anything under a 50mm lens, but were fine with telephoto lenses. So that's what they ended up on. This adapter just barely fails to reach infinity with a 28mm lens. If the lens (An FD 28/2.8) is stopped down to f4 then it makes it, barely. With a 20mm lens it doesn't make it until stopped down to f8. So if you're buying this for use on a 35mm lens or above, it's fine. Below that, I'd find something else. Of course all this applies to full frame.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because it is well built and would work great on longer lenses.",6/6/2015

The ones I tested were the Fotodiox, the Neewer, and the Fogta.  First, I shall reiterate what others have said, that these are manual focus and aperture adapters, and they do not use lens elements that reduce image quality.  You set your NEX to allow lens release, and it has no communication with the lens.  You do it all by hand, just like in the olden days, which is why I love using these so much!<br /><br />The cheaper Neewer and Fogta appear to be set at infinity, but each of them has a little bit of play in the mount--they're not completely snug.  I later noticed that the Neewer sometimes seemed to hit infinity just right, and then sometimes, it couldn't reach infinity!  Huh?  It may have been temperature induced (had trouble hitting infinity in hotter weather), but I think it's more because of the play in the mount.  Hitting infinity focus requires very tight tolerances.  Since the adapter is a little loose, if it's not in complete contact with the camera, it will never reach infinity.  I had to wiggle the lens and adapter while pulling it tight against my camera, and then it popped back to infinity.  So it's a cheap mount, what do you expect?  I'd rather have an adapter that's just a hair shorter, having that safety factor of going slightly beyond infinity. The apeture lock on the Neewer adapter is very smooth and buttery, so I appreciate that.  I have not experienced the problem of not reaching infinity on the Fogta adapter; it does seem to be set on infinity, but knowing what a small tolerance that is, It wouldn't surprise me if there's a chance it might not always hit it on certain lenses since there's no room for error.  My only complaint about the Fogta adapter is that the aperture lock ring is loose feeling.  It's a little harder to snap into place, and then it kind of wiggles after you set it. I don't think that actually matters for its function, but it makes it feel cheaper.  Also, the Fotodiox and Neewer shipped very quickly, and the Fogta took a few weeks to ship from China.  I use the Fogta and Neewer adapters on my portrait and macro lenses, where I rarely need to think about infinity, and a little wiggle in the mount doesn't bother these smaller lenses.<br /><br />The Fotodiox was the most expensive, and, after some consideration, the best.  At first, I did not like the fact that the Fotodiox is set a little past infinity.  The fact is that I rarely focus straight to infinity on the lenses I am using--I am doing macro, portrait, and long telephoto lenses with these adapters, it's more likely to be a wide angle landscape lens that you send straight to infinity when you shoot, and I have that in my NEX kit lens (which strangely seems to lack a specific infinity point, but that's another story). I also now appreciate that this extra sliver of focus makes sure that you should be able to safely hit infinity on every lens, which was a concern with the other adapters. What I like most about the Fotodiox adapter is that it really fits the camera and lenses snugly with no play, unlike the cheaper adapters.  So I tend to use this adapter on my long telephoto to make sure that it's extra secure.  I'm buying one more adapter, and the Fotodiox will be the one, despite that it costs twice what the others cost.  The others do work, however, and the adapter does not affect image quality.er shipped very quickly, and the Fogta took a few weeks to ship from China.

US,19547311,R5FENYQKIXTIW,B00004TX77,198120,Lowepro Camera Beltpack/Bag,Camera,5,1,1,N,Y,the perfect camera bag.,"I looked long and hard to find just the right bag for my Nikon D40 with the 18-200 lens.  This has been everything I hoped for and more.  I love the ease and accessibility of having this in front of me and not having to take off a pack to get at my gear, or having to deal with the weight of something hanging around my neck.  I've since graduated to a D90, and that with the 18-200 still just fits.  I have the Nikon 70-300 lens too, and that does not fit.  If I have a smaller lens I could wear this all day with no discomfort.  my lower back does get a tad sore if I'm toting the 18-200 lens around all day, but it's manageable.  If I am hiking and wearing a day pack with a waistband, I fasten the waistband under this and it does wonders to take the pressure off of my lower back!  One additional feature of this that I like is being able to slide it around 180 degrees and wear it backward if the occasion demands.  for instance if I was doing some climbing and it would be in the way or if I'm on my road bike.  and yet when I want it it's easy to slide around to the front.  when in back the weight is also supported by my butt, so it's surprisingly comfortable to wear it that way..  I've had this now for many years and it has literally been all over the world with me and has held up very well.",11/10/2014

In-fact I would gladly pay another $20 just for a top that fit right. It's just wasn't thought out very well. The flip over top was designed to cover the flash, only problem is that they didn't measure the flash correctly and made the flash pod about a half inch too long. This forces the back of the case to bend a 1/2 inch behind the back of the camera, leaving a wedge shaped gap between the top and bottom of the camera.<br />This is a good looking Reto-design, beautifully stitched and looks like real leather.

Allow me to start from the beginning. I received this battery charger and 2 batteries, along with a car charger adapter plug. Also included in the box was a UK/US two prong plug adapter. Nice touch. I was not expecting that. The packaging was more than sufficient to protect the contents. That gave a hint that this may be a quality unit. Quality packaging, quality contents - hopefully. I unwrapped the disconnected cable, plugged it into the unit, and inserted a Kastar battery. When I plugged the cord into the AC outlet, the battery registered as having a %78 charge on it already. I watched the charger's voltage increase as time passed, and the percentage of charge increased. That's a good thing. There must always be a difference of potential to charge. If the battery and charger ever reach equilibrium, charging stops.  I timed this initial charge cycle. It took roughly 2 hours (actually 1 hr 55 mins) to reach %100. At that point I began writing this review. Then I noticed that the charger began charging once again, and the battery charge was at %98. There is always a little instability within any rechargeable battery. You don't see it because most battery chargers do not have an LCD display that shows that. This one however does. As the battery would &#34;drift&#34; to a lower charge level the charger would again begin charging. Even my Canon battery charger doesn't do that. With it, once charge is completed, the green light illuminates, and charging stops unless you remove the so called charged battery, and place it back on the charger. Then the charger will again begin to charge the battery. I like this charger because I do not have to monitor its charging cycle. It will continue to charge the battery if the battery charge drifts to a lower percent of charging level. Finally, someone has fixed this problem. My hat goes off to Kastar.  I read the instructions and it states that the charger and battery will prevent overcharging. This means for the user that you can just plug this in when you go to bed, and in the morning the battery has been charged, and kept at %100 charge all night, without damage.  I like this charger. 5 star rating.",3/12/2015

A simple solution could be to sell an extension (to insert between the side plate and the bottom one) with a longer screw, or include that extension in the kit.

US,12176592,R3H0XF9YV5X7MA,B00BMVQEM4,302548,BRAND NEW SLING POUCH FROM CARRYSPEED MADE BY NEOPRENE,Camera,3,1,1,N,Y,CarrySpeed Sling Pouch and Canon T4i,"I purchased this thinking it to be a fantastic alternative to the bulky carrycase. And to an extent it is. The concept is good and appears to serve its purpose when wrapped around your camera. However, once off the camera, it transforms into this annoyingly hollow yet distractingly large appendage that does nothing but dangle from the end of your camera strap.<br /><br />One would think the good outweighs the bad, but I'm still undecided. With each camera shot I feel this shadow of a case floating beneath me. It's uselessness at that point will begin to grate on your nerves. You can't help but wonder if the manufacturer could have designed it to fold into itself to become less obtrusive when not in use.<br /><br />The case itself appears to be well made with approximately 4.5 mm thick neoprene material. A close examination of the stitching bears the mark of a quality made product. At points along the case (left, right, and bottom sides) are 3 high-impact plastic D rings for latching anything you see fit to the case. I was somewhat disappointed because the YouTube video of this product stated it would come with a carabiner so you could latch the case to a belt loop. However, this did not include one.<br /><br />At the top of the case just under the high-quality rubberized CarrySpeed logo is a single finger hold, of which, use becomes increasingly apparent with practice. Essentially I use this as the grip point for pulling the cover off my camera. At the bottom is a 360 degree swivel latch-mount for attachment to your professional sling strap of any brand. I use a Joby sling strap which is quite compatible. However, be it known that CarrySpeed does offer their own line of slings as well. Ordinarily I prefer matching brands, but instead I chose Joby over the CarrySpeed straps due to some viable negative reviews.<br /><br />There is a 2.5 inch by 3.5 inch zippered pocket stitched into the outer backside of this case for storing a DSLR battery and additional flat media cards. I have successfully tested it for the storage of one Canon T4i sized battery with its protective plastic cover and one 64GB SDXC memory card with its oblong plastic case and all fit without any problems.<br /><br />And finally you have what I will call your dog ears which are 2 neoprene straps that extend from each side of the bottom of the neoprene case and are designed to wrap under, then stretch back over to be overlapped upon one another and secure via their velcro stitching.<br /><br />My current setup fits well. That being a Canon T4i sized camera body with an EFS 18-135mm lens and a Canon EW-73B lens hood (reversed for storage). In all honesty, I would not have any room to go much larger as it can be a struggle to get the case back on with what I have already. Allow me to clarify; it is not a tight fit once the case is on, it is merely a struggle getting the case past the sides of the camera sometimes. With practice, quickly taking the case off is a smooth process, and that's really all that matters to ensure you don't miss the shot. However as stated, getting the case back on can be awkward at times and is not as quick a process as I would prefer when I'm trying to stay on the move or keep up with a group.<br /><br />Just like practicing with your sling strap, this too will take some getting used to; especially because you now have to practice getting these items to work together. All in all I'd have to say this case is quite innovative and the best thing going at the moment, so it may be worth your purchase.",10/30/2013

I've had the T and this lens for two months.  I've taken the T along with this lens on two major trips and shot nearly 1500 images (all with this lens).  Let me start off by saying that this lens covers about 98% of the focal range I find most useful.  I seem to have wide angle dyslexia and don't feel comfortable with a lens that is wider than this lens.  Conversely, at the tele length, anything much over 90mm is too limiting a perspective.  So, at a 35mm equivalent of 27-84, I find this lens to be nearly perfect for an everyday travel lens.<br /><br />The reason I have given this lens 4 out of 5 stars is because at the maximum tele length, the images exhibit a little less detail and crispness than I have experience with Leica glass.  Specifically, I had an X Vario for about one year (sold to finance the purchase of this lens and the T) and I think that lens was more crisp at the tele length.  I have shot this lens at all sorts of f-stops and find that 5.6 to 9 is the ideal range on the T (any more than f9, even pushing to f11 and diffraction sets in).<br /><br />Also, and parenthetically, I have found that shooting the T (again with this lens) using manual settings (f9, shutter speed of 200) and Auto ISO (with a range of 100-3200) so the camera is choosing an ISO to match the f9 aperture and 1/200 shutter speed to be the ideal setting for the most crisp shots this lens is capable of.<br /><br />Overall I'd probably give this lens 4.5 stars if that were possible.  And I would very much recommend this lens to any prospective or current T owner.",9/24/2014

Orion's unit powers two separate USB outlets while the Celestron unit powers individual 3,6 & 9v ports.  I have used them all without problem, but I lean more towards the USB usage.  The Celestron unit has jumper cables built in with alligator clips on the open end, the Orion unit does not have cables but does have connectors to hook jumper cables or screw on eyelets.  I have used the Celestron unit once to jump a neighbors car without incident, but I bought these batteries to operate my telescope, so I don't really care about jumper cables.  If you ever wanted to parallel batteries however, I think the Orion set up would provide the more secure option.  Last, Orion costs about $11 more than does Celestron.<br />Operationally:  As stated, my Celestron unit is 6 years old, I've never had a problem with it, the charger or components. the Orion is brand new.  Both have AM & FM radio's which are limited in functionality.  I don't use them when star gazing and if I wanted music, I'd use other source options.  I also do not use the spot light but both work.  The removable red flashlight is great!  The Celestron light is brighter than the preferred Orion's dimmer  light (night vision).  Both are well made with very good quality.<br />My only CON is that I wish they made it easier to change the battery.  It's cheaper to replace, but you don't  know about the control electronics or charger circuits in a new unit!<br />I have a Celestron CPC scope with GPS, built in tripod lights, up to 6 dew heaters and a controller, and the detachable red light.  I've used the Celestron Power Tank for over 6 hours straight and an additional 4 hours in sleep mode.  So far, the Orion unit has powered everything for only 3 hours straight.  If the Orion unit provides the longevity that my Celestron has, I know I'll love it.

The rails on the bottom are removable, so I took them off, and screwed on my baseplate and own carbon-fiber rails. Shot an entire feature, and it's rock solid, for literally one tenth the price of a HotRod or Chrosziel. Only gripe is that it blocks ventilation some, but not entirely. I drilled an additional hold in the bottom, and there were no problems. Spending more on a less useful cage is downright stupid.

I am using Chrome and it is working great. Remote viewing of my home security cameras, good to go. Some of the options available on the DVR are really nice. One example is the very well designed screen to block out areas you don't want to trigger the record-on-motion-detected.<br /><br />Instructions are written by a native English speaker (can't take that for granted nowadays).

I was hesitant about those systems that were clean and slick to look at but I found out the only way to access menus and control was either from the all in one remote or the mouse. God forbid if the remote got lost or broken then how do you even turn the darn thing on/off. So I admit I am a bit of a traditionalist/hybrid when it comes to electronics. The performance is good, it provides settings for qvga or vga (good/better) images. The unit is lightweight but shell feel solid enough, I put my flat screen monitor on top of it without denting the top of the shell. The back has options for output (VGA, HDMI) which I used the HDMI into a 19\\"" led TV that I found on sale. The menu setup is not as user friendly or intuitive as I'd like but once I played around I kind of understood where/why they put it under what folder.<br /><br />Pro:<br />-Price was usually less than other if not comparable/cheaper than generic no names<br />-Build is better than most I explored<br />-Q See is a name I know of<br />-Compatible with my Swann nanny cams too! In the works for patching them in somehow, if I need to,  I have no problems buying another Q See DVR<br />-Can access menu through optical mouse (included) or button.<br />-Playback remote included w/ batteries<br />-Can be usb backup via external hard drive<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The buttons on the unit do not light up...non contrasting scheme makes it somewhat difficult to read.<br />-Menus/software not as user friendly but still better than most I can say that!! Still easier to use than zmodos menus<br />TIP: in menu when searching for recorded files and/or images (in file management) if not sure about time, leave search empty - select the day and just click search. It will pull up the whole day's records.<br />-Remote and mouse feels cheap but it serves its function well. The mouse is USB and optical FYI.<br />-There is no separate manual on/off switch. If you want to shut it down you must go through the menu and it takes longer than I thought to actually shut down or use the stop/esc button on DVR and hold it for 2 secs. The on/off that is supposed to work which is the left button with the red does not turn ON the unit. With no manual toggle..I literally have to unplug it and replug it for it to turn on. Don't know why that is but I see common complains about the same thing and I thought maybe I would not get a buggy unit..I think it maybe design. It is still not enough for me to return it though.<br /><br />Overall, I am pretty happy with it. I will stress that you should couple this with a set of decent cameras though. More tvl means clearer pics so the qsee cams I bought are pretty good considering the price. They are the bullet style cams 600 tvls. Decent detail and fairly accurate color at 30 ft give or take. A few of my indoor mini cams are 450 tvls and u can seen the difference. Generally the safer bet for outside is dont go below 500tvl if that. I didn't need the detail indoors so that's fine. Outdoors I say spring for the better details so u have something substantial for police reports. Decent lower res cam can run about 30 to 60 bucks. The decent tvl res cams will hit about the 50 to 100+ range. Then u have pro which can get insane with pan tilt room etc 150 to hundreds more. I will tweek some of the settings some more on a later date but for now, I see my mailman/UPS dude tossing my mail around like bocci ball and neighbors that don't clean up after their pups..WTH!<br /><br />UPDATE: 11/1/2013 - I expanded my system and purchased a zmodo 8 ch dvr. I am using both just separated them by duty. I will say compared to the zmodo, I still like the functionality of the menus on the qsee more. The Qsee allows to search files by events i.e. motion, power loss etc. The zmodo - it gives a time grid as well with blue range markers to narrow the time frame but unless you have an idea, it seems you maybe replaying the whole day when you were gone. I also noticed that real time display seems clearer from the qsee dvr than the zmodo and I checked the advanced settings. The qsee was running either HDMI or VGA - the zmodo I tried coaxial/RCA and VGA (the zmodo has no HDMI). Eitherway the results were the same and yes, I used the same 600 TVL qsee cams in NTSC/D1.aying the whole day when you were gone.

I have installed several Q-See camera systems, and I like the product.  However, potential buyers should know the following:<br />1.  The DVR is great.  The QT model series in particular is easy to work with, and has better app support than some others.  It even has a PTZ control, in case you want to add a PT or PTZ camera.<br />2.  This particular model of camera, as I later learned, is inferior to current Q-See cameras with similar features.  I have installed this model before, and usually had to deal with nothing other than washed-out color images (a trademark of this model).  My luck on this transaction was worse.  Of the 4 cameras, all had out-of-focus, fish-eyed images that could not be corrected.  On 2 of the cameras, the night vision pictures were too dark.<br />Conclusion:  Because of the particular model of cameras, your purchase is a gamble.

That said, if you're planning to DIY, take his words with a grain of salt because--well, he's a professional with all the right tools, equipment, and patience.<br /><br />Setting up the system was easy enough--using an old 24&#34; LCD computer monitor and a powerline network adapter (otherwise you'd need to hardwire it to your router or modem)--though their user interface could stand to be a little friendlier.

Their iOS and Android apps aren't the shiniest I've witnessed, but they function and allow the system to be administered remotely.<br /><br />The image quality is good, certainly better than some of I've seen, though not as crisp as others. Basically, image quality is above average.

Ever watch surveillance footage on TV, like on the news when a crime has been committed and the authorities need the public's help identifying the perpetrator? And the video is terrible and you wonder why? If the victim had one of these systems installed you'd look at the footage and say (for example) &#34;Hey, that's my brother-in-law&#34; instead of &#34;Well, we might be able to help if you hadn't cheaped out on you security system...&#34;<br />Seriously, there's no point in installing a system if it doesn't provide usable video. You might as well install dummy deterrent cameras and keep your fingers crossed. You can pay more and get HD but it's not really necessary.<br /><br />This is an excellent choice for either the home or small business user.

So when we had the chance to get this Q-See system, we jumped in.  Wow, we realized right away that we had a lot to learn, but that was one of the biggest advantages of Q-See over other choices:  tons of support by way of detailed, easy-to-understand instructions (on a convenient disc and on the website), and really helpful (and patient!) customer support.<br /><br />We were able to install it and get it set up ourselves with a minimal amount of swearing, and no extra parts leftover. All kidding aside, though, this is worth its' weight in gold because of the peace of mind it gives us.  And at night, wow, sleeping way more peacefully knowing we can count on our Q-See to alert us of any motion that might indicate a problem.  The technical bag of tricks that this system offers is admittedly beyond our comprehension at these early stages of our monitoring, but every day we discover a new feature that gives us even more confidence that we made the right choice.",11/28/2013

Recently we had our home alarm system upgraded and activated and the company showed us a video surveillance system that is exactly like what Q-See offers here. The thing is if we had the company install their equipment there is an equipment charge and labor installation plus $30 a month for video monitoring including use of a mobile device or PC based viewing system (just like what Q-See offers). Thus my interest in this product was as an add-on to our existing home security system which has professional monitoring.<br /><br />The QT5680-4E4-1 is a wired product so installation and use will require drilling, running wire in walls and some ladder climbing, just be forewarned. You supply a video monitor such as a 19 inch or larger PC monitor with VGA cable or a TV with an HDMI cable and a BNC to RCA cable or adapter. They also recommend the use of a surge protector. I'm sharing these things to explain and so you can equip yourself with what you need when you are ready to install it.<br /><br />The product comes with a poster sized large font quick start installation guide with full color photos. A CD is included with all the fine print for the owner's manual.<br /><br />Some things that make this set remarkable is the fact that it is weatherproof and has night vision as well as DVR abilities that capture 30 frames per second. These are in color except the night vision of course! Unlike a different camera we tried, this does not capture a frame every few seconds which gives a ridiculous stop motion film type quality.<br /><br />I think it's really cool that you can monitor your system while away from home using a mobile device such as an iPhone. We have our security system in place which is professionally monitored and if something happens, no matter where I am I can look to see what is happening from afar. I can also peek in on the house while I am away in case I am curious about what is going on.<br /><br />Q-See offers some other products such as wireless cameras and full color cameras as well.<br /><br />I am impressed to say the least. I rate this product 5 stars = I Love It.<br /><br />The product info here on Amazon is exhaustive and lists the many features and compatibilities. The Q-See website gives a ton of information. I found some customer tutorials on YouTube so you can watch other people using the system and see how they chose to install it in their homes. Q-See also has official videos on YouTube that explain the product. I hope all that information is helpful to you as you shop and compare products.o peek in on the house while I am away in case I am curious about what is going on.<br /><br />Q-See offers some other products such as wireless cameras and full color cameras as well.<br /><br />I am impressed to say the least.

You run the wires, you &#34;plug the wires in with the given connectors. You give the Unit a LOCAL ip, lets say our PC is 192.168.100.5, you would make this something in that series, say 192.168.100.9 (make sure not in use). The EMAIL feature is crazy good, when someone walks in front of the camera, not only does it send me an email, but I can configure it to send an email from ALL 8 CAMERAS (and for how many seconds) at that time. WOW. The Playback also works well for me, despite me using Windows 8 and IE 11. If you have an older QS, this will work with the CIF cams, but don't expect it to be perfect. In addition this will work in conjunction with other QSEE boxes. It also has a low hard drive warning, sends and email with defaults of disk space left. This would REALLY be useful for my mailbox/package cam. I get a package and camera senses movement, send me an email. Not sure what else to get excited about, there are 2 audio jacks, you need to buy another mic for that from what I understand. I use a Static set of IPs, so I can just make a static name on the internet like XYZ.mycompany.com, but you being a home user most likely can use the dynamic DNS feature on the box.

The system can also be expanded up to four more cameras that you can purchase separately.<br /><br />The cameras themselves are small, yet very potent. The image is fine with 700 lines of resolution. Of course it's not Full HD... but given the use of these cameras, it is unlikely you'll need more than that. The night vision capabilities is IMPRESSIVE... you really can see perfectly at a large distance. The manufacturer claims 100 feet. Although I did not measure, I must say those cameras allow me to see (in darkness) as far as I need and probably more. I'm totally satisfied there!<br /><br />The wide-angle lenses are a good compromise giving you a good angle of vision without the typical distortion of wider angle lenses. The free apps that allow you to interact with the system on your iPad works fine with me.<br /><br />All in all, a great system that will take care of most (if not all) of your surveillance need.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED!!!",11/7/2013

This is the primary video output from the dvr and must use VGA to be able to get the menu to change it to HDMI, and if you unplug the dvr you have to redo the VGA cable and change your settings all over again. They failed to mention this or include a VGA to HDMI adapter for this. I bought it for HDMI because thats what it said it uses. Then technical support you can just forget about calling because they dont know anything or understand English.

The problem is the resolution on the dvr I received was set up from the mfg for an hdtv, so I could not see a picture due to my tv not recognizing the resolution.  After several online chats with a pretty much useless rep, I figured out I needed to buy bcd-rca adapter from a well known electronics store so I could hook the output to my rca inputs(my unit came with only  a hdmi cable).  After this, I was able to see the set up menu, change the resolution so I could hook it up to my hdmi jack.<br /><br />The cameras were very good quality with the exception of one, which looked very hazy during night vision mode.

Even though the wires are long enough to reach from the camera location to the COMMAND  center, any installer must expect getting additional video/power cable and (MALE) connector, sometimes you just cannot run it straight line, two of mine each took 100 feet cable luckily I had 4 50ft extra cables in hand. (This is a plug and play) or simply easy to install thing, you don't need to be what they call (professional?) I don't think so! make sure you identify which side of the cable goes to the camera and which side goes to the DVR, if you just pool a 50ft cable in a attic and end up pulling it back, it just feels like bad day! NOTE: Please DO NOT leave the cable wrapped make sure you UNWRAP all of it, even when you don't need the whole 50 feet to do the job! If you leave it wrapped the cable heats up and can even caught on fire, this have something to do with electric current circulation in the wire, I had two of them left wrapped and when I went inside the attic and check they were both smelling like burned plastic and really hot, I am luck I didn't do this the 2nd day or hour, this happened in 7 to 10 minutes.<br /><br />SETTUP: After you are done with installation grab your favorite drink and take 10 to 20 minutes rest to refresh yourself, now everything is plugged in and your TV is set to display your cameras, &#34; POWER ON&#34; your DVR and follow onscreen instruction to change your default USER NAME and PASSWORD (CREATE YOUR OWN USER NAME AND PASSWORD)  because all the default ones are default for many other models.  in my case the 1st thing I did was run the RJ45 from my secure DVR room to my router, this is done as part of the whole installation (THIS SYSTEM DOES NOT SUPPORT WIFI)  you cannot connect it to your LAN using wifi, you definitely need free network port on your switch/router. Insert the CD into your pc/laptop and install the software (mine didn't work with win7 64 so I went on their website and download the latest version. Now your remote monitoring from the PC/MAC side is done. go to app/play store and download the app that is made for your specific model, you will find an option to scan ( A BARCODE)  located on top of your DVR, scan it and it will give you an option to login.

The wizard blew up for some reason after I set up the wifi/local network settings so I had to go manual. Some notes so you don't have to go through the pain.      1) If your intranet (local wifi) web interface stops working it might be because your wifi router changed the ip of the dvr, so make sure you go into your router and assign the dvr a static ip.      2) If you use the PnP (plug and play ha-ha-ha, RIGHT! Plug and play my a$$) DDNS option on setting up the box for remote viewing, you have to log into the myq-see.com site and get your own url by setting up an account. Then, to see your system on the internet you address it like this    mynetwork.myq-see.com:85    where 85 is the port you forward from the box through your router to the internet, which you have to set up and mynetwork is what YOU have named your network when you registered. A little detail they seemed to have missed on the not so quick startup guide.      3) Whether you're using the myq-see network you signed up for, or you are just using the external ip of your own network YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT THE INTERNET SEES OUTSIDE OF YOUR FIREWALL. Important point missing from the instructions. In other words, you might have a loopback problem seeing the system if you use an external url. Instead of setting up a loopback adapter my advice is to go see it from your office or neighbor or use the Q-see QT phone app which uses the same url and port (and make sure your phone is NOT connected to your home wifi system, but using 4g or something) to check the remote internet viewing. One more time, because this is a killer: you might not be able to check the internet remote viewing from within your own network. Go outside your network to check it. If you want to use the system with computers within your wifi system, use the wifi assigned internal address of thedvr. This will be something like: [...] where 85 is the port the DVR is sending on, unless yours sends on another port. Again: if you are within the same network as the dvr use the static IP address you assigned through your router to view the web app.",12/24/2013

The setup is very easy, you set the date, mount the cameras and the cords you use have both the video and the power attached together.<br /><br />Since my house has a lot of trees (making it hard to get a bird's eye view), I mounted them low, kept the DVR in my basement and ran the cables out of basement windows (easy to run cable in your basement)<br /><br />The video quality is good even at night (when it is black and what); like watching a VHS tape.  But if something major happens to you, you will wish you had HD.  My car was broken into during the day time, I was very happy to have video of what happened, but if I had HD instead of high resolution I would have had a better look at his face and most importantly, I would have gotten his license plate number (this guy drove to our area to walk around and look in car windows)<br /><br />For the money, it is worth it.  These are the negatives:<br /><br />One camera went bad immediately just from me unplugging the DVR itself.  Even though the power is separate, I guess that sent a surge that blew it out.  Q-See sent me a replacement.<br /><br />A 2nd camera went bad 2 months after having it.  I sent it to Q-See and I hope a replacement is coming.  I was able to see when the camera stopped working and nothing happened to cause it.  It went from recording to being a frozen screen to just dying.<br /><br />So will these last long term?  I tend to think they will not and I don't want to be buying replacement cameras periodically.<br /><br />If you video constantly and use the best quality on all cameras (as I do) you only have 6 days worth of history before the old stuff gets written over.  It's easy to write video onto flash drives, but sometimes you realize something happened more than a week before and you are SOL unless you decrease the quality or video less (like set it to record only when it detects motion).",12/22/2013

I had been using a high dollar alarm company installed system that cost five times more, and the QT5680 surpassed its older technology for waaaay less. FYI alarm companies still charge five times more for basically the same thing.<br /><br />The cameras included in this system are 600TVL resolution which are very good compared to other packaged systems that come with 420TVL. The cameras provide a clear and true color representation with the IR cut filter. At night the IR LEDs provide just the right amount of light within a reasonable distance.<br /><br />The DVR is very compact and doesn't take up too much space for an 8-channel system. It records at Full D1 resolution for all 8 channels which I believe is today's minimum standard compared to older outdated systems that record at CIF resolution.<br /><br />This DVR also included an option to connect cameras that have built-in microphones so that you may record audio as well. The DVR has user friendly menus and is pretty simple to setup with or without the easy to follow fold-out instructions.<br />Accessing the DVR from an outside network didn't present any problems after properly configuring the router and setting up a Dynamic DNS account.<br /><br />I was impressed with the software ability to access the DVR from my smartphone. The quality of the live feed viewing of the cameras was high as expected. I was very impressed by the feature of being able to search and play back files stored on the DVR from my smartphone. Playback of the video files was very fast with no lag and was very smooth.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this system for anyone looking to install a decent system on a budget.

Right now I am currently working on a 60 camera install with 40 PTZ's at a cost of 1800 per PTZ.<br /><br />I was looking for a system for my home but really didn't want to spend too much money on a system just for my house. So I began looking. I spend 2-3 weeks searching and going between 2-3 different packages and arrived on this one. It was a great price, and game with a tb hard drive and 8 cameras. Can't complain. So I ordered it.<br /><br />I wired it before it arrived at my house. I bought 4x4x2 crylon boxes and after I had all the wires in place (6 exterior, 2 interior), I mounted the Crylon boxes outside and mounted the Cameras to those. It looks really sharp. I have already gotten compliments o how it looks.<br /><br />I then bought a nice little 16 inch flat screen dedicated for my DVR. (It was 80 bucks). I set the DVR up which was mostly straight forward. A few options they put into places I'm not used too but no big deal there. All manufacturers have their own scheme. I really like the interface though and how it looks. BIG name brands like Samsung have clunkier schemes. I hooked it up to the internet and was viewing these bad boys on my phones and computers in the house within minutes. Easiest Network setup I have ever done.<br /><br />The only real &#34;complaint&#34; I have it that the 2 interior cameras have a really hard time staying in their color/day mode. Ill check at 3pm with ample light and they will be in dark/black and white mode. Kind of annoying but I will move them around and see if I can get better ambient lighting for them.

I was doubtful of the IR, but works like a charm.<br />My suggestion is, if you don't know exactly where you want to put a fixed camera, but a controllable camera instead.<br />Running cable takes some planning, but you don't have to worry about wireless reception, range, interference, or frame-drop out.<br />I did have to call my ISP and get them to open the two ports in their DSL router. They also had to give me a fixed IP address and not a dynamic address. So expect to have to deal with your ISP if you want to access the cameras by the Web. Which, by the way, is awesome. My two girls can log into the DVR from their computers and watch the house for me! I loaded the Q-See app on my Android phone and can see all 4 cameras on my cell phone. Again, totally cool.

And this one is even better.<br /><br />My first one was an eight channel DVR about two or three years old and it still going strong and works fantastic. So when I bought this new one I was expecting a good experience. I was not expecting an even better experience.<br /><br /> In the last three or four years they've -<br /> -improved their instructions<br />-their interface and even the look of the DVR.<br /><br />Understand these are not quick installs they are wired cameras you have to plan out where you want to put them and you really don't want to make a mistake because you're drilling into your house. But once you map out where you want the cameras figure out how you're going to fish the wires through the wall you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />The camera's have really improved since my first q-see device and now that I've used their pan/tilt camera, I think I'm going to be spending a lot of money replacing the fixed cameras around here. The fixed cameras are great but it always seems there's one or two spots in the room you can't see. But with the pan/tilt camera nothing is out of your sight. And the fact that they include one in the set for this price is fantastic.<br /><br />And the night vision works fantastically!<br /><br />The really cool thing is you can view your cameras when you're not at home using your Smart phone. But keep in mind setting this part up is a little more t difficult. They give you really good and detailed instructions on how to set your rougher  up. but you might want to have a computer savvy friend with you when you do this part.<br /><br />So basically take a weekend to plan out where you want to put your cameras be ready to do some port forwarding on your router then you will have an awesome camera/security system.

As it turned out, we both read the instructions and they were easy to follow. Written in plain english, everything made sense and was not even remotely confusing. I connected  this to my flat screen through the HDMI port. We planned where the cameras would be mounted. I observed and handed him tools,etc. while my husband attached all the cameras in strategic places around the house again following the manufacturer's easy to follow instructions.<br />The DVR is unobtrusive and slides in easily with all the other home electronics. It is also super quiet. When we were ready to test this out we set up an iPad, iPhone, and computer to access the DVR via softwear provided by Q-SEE. The pan and tilt camera is easy to use and provides great coverage. Ditto for the bullet cameras provided.The night vision capability of the cameras offers a clear picture without additional light sources. Overall, I am impressed by the Q-See's modest price given its performance. It does what you want a home monitoring system to do without costing big bucks. Whether you are monitoring your home for theft, covering the nanny or babsitter's activities, or checking up on the teenagers, this is a great way to know what's happening. While I have a professional home monitoring system which I pay a monthly fee for, this unit is a welcome addition for extra protection.<br />My only gripe is that my home is on the large size at 2600 sq. feet so I wish this particular configuration came with more cameras.

Some might never be useful but they are there for you. I was looking for a friendly to the user system. If that is what you are looking for my friend this is it! I have tested the night vision part and I was able to see pretty decently more than 75 feet. Today it snowed too much but the day time photo quality was very good. I am planning to purchase several more for my business in Africa. Good job Q-see. I haven't tested the pan and tilt camera yet but that will happen soon. The dome looked small but I am not going to underestimate this product. I had thought that the bullet cameras were too small and light but they proved their worth!

I have looked at a number of security cameras including many at a bricks and mortar store and most have a very plastic feel - you can tell that out in the weather they will not hold up. Not so with the Q-See cameras. They feel sturdy and well constructed. Lots of metal.<br /><br />The non-tilt cameras are small enough to be unobtrusive near a front door (which is where I have elected to put one) - and the larger pan-tilt camera is perfect for a back yard with the ability to look all around. A camera aimed at the driveway is a must, of course.<br /><br />Once you have selected locations, get ready to do some drillin' since these are wired cameras. Although there are wireless solutions out there I would not recommend them since, of course, you need to run a wire to them for power anyway unless you want to spend all your time replacing batteries. The included cables are good and they wisely packed them in such a way that you can access both ends - makes testing out the system before installation easy.<br /><br />System set up was also easy and the directions are well done - clearly they were written or corrected by someone who is fluent in English, something that is not always the case in products of this type. I followed the directions step by step and was checking out the quality of the video in just a couple minutes. (Installation of cameras has taken a bit longer of course!)<br /><br />Overall, I'm very impressed with this item which is well made and functional. It is just what I was looking for!",11/21/2013
US,50622061,R1UBN082THNI6Y,B00DY2Y5OI,424697,Q-See QT5680-1 1 TB 8-Channel Full D1 Surveillance DVR,Camera,4,20,24,Y,N,A worthy first step into a pro-style security camera setup,"I have tried numerous consumer-oriented IP cameras, but this is the first pro-style model I have tried. I know from experience with multiple other cameras that these cameras usually start out as professional models, or are made by professional surveillance companies, and are adapted for the consumer market. When that happens, the packaging and marketing text makes it sound like it is easy to get them up and running by the average user, but it is a veneer that wears off once you start trying to set it up. Q-See does fall into that category, but they executed the setup process better than most I have tried. The bottom line is, I ended up getting everything to work as advertised with less frustration.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) They try to make it easier for the average user with large installation posters with a lot of photo illustrations<br />2) The automatic setup software actually worked, for once<br />3) Cameras provide a nice field of view<br />4) Appears to be well made and designed to weather the elements<br />5) Night vision is usable<br />6) Overall, they succeed in avoiding requiring the user to buy a networking dictionary, but you still need to dig a little to understand some terminology<br />7) Viewing IP cameras on a smartphone has been one of the biggest challenges I have had with IP cameras. Some I have tried simply never worked, even though the manufacturer says it's possible. Others I have gotten to work for reasons I cannot explain. The best thing I can say about this product is that I can view the cameras over my smartphone, so I'm not going to push my luck. However, the apps they provide apparently give many peoples issues (see Cons below)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Instructions are still not as easy as I think they need to be for the average user. While parts of the instructions were easy to understand and follow, they did not necessarily flow from one thing to the next. I am really not sure how I got everything working. Seems like I jumped around between instruction sheets and steps. I also had to do some searching on their web site. I had to install several pieces of software and drivers, but I'm not quite sure yet what they are for, or how to work them. I doubt I could guide someone else through how to set it up. Still, somehow, I got it to work<br />2) While the automatic setup software worked for me, if it doesn't for you, then you are thrown into the daunting world of port forwarding! This is something all other IP cameras I have used I have had to deal with. Digging into your router's settings is not the most user friendly process<br />3) The consumer friendly veneer wears off the deeper you go. The more you go into the settings sections, the more it looks like territory only a security or network professional could love. Still, like I mention in the Pros section, they do abetter job of explaining than other products I have used<br />4) There is no wireless anything on this product. For the sake of security, everything is wired. This means you have to figure out where you want your cameras and then determine if there is a place for the dvr to go that allows all the wires to be connected. Of course, you have to run the wires to and fro, meaning you may need to get on the roof. The dvr also needs to be hard wired to your network, otherwise you need to connect it to a TV or monitor. I think most people are going to want to use it on their desktop and/or smartphone, though. This, then, requires the dvr to be connected to the network. I ended up placing the dvr in the loft space in my garage. I connected it to the network using powerline adapters. It worked<br />5) When setting it up, you need to see a screen of some sort. The way I did it was I temporarily moved my dvr to near my desktop and plugged my computer monitor into it. This allowed me to follow the setup screen instructions to set up port forwarding. Once that is done, you can move the dvr back to where you want it. Then, I was able to use the viewing software on my computer to continue setup and monitor the cameras<br />6) The smartphone software they provide is confusing. They have a lot of different versions and it is hard to figure out which one to use. The only way I figured it out was by going to their web site, searching for android apps, inputting some info and finding the exact app for me. The only other issue with the apps is that the viewer ratings for most of theirs is very poor. It worked on my phone, but it looks like many people have some major issues<br /><br />So, basically, I can say this: So far, so good. These cameras look and perform like high end security cameras, compared to the plastic cased, over-styled consumer IP cameras I have been using. Despite a lot of little things to assemble and setup, I did actually get the system to work as advertised with a lot less frustration that other IP cameras I have used. As a first step into a pro-style security camera setup, I believe the Q-See system is a good start for the average user, as long as you are willing to invest the time and effort needed to set it up, i.e., it's still not simple and easy.g software on my computer to continue setup and monitor the cameras<br />6) The smartphone software they provide is confusing.

Functionality is fairly robust for domestic usage with a 1 Terabyte DVR (8 camera inputs), 3 stationary bullet cams and a nifty pan-tilt camera all enabled with remote viewing capability to allow monitoring through phone/tablet/computer apps wherever you may be located.<br /><br />Some thoughts on this kit:<br />+Setup is fairly easy with better than expected instructions.  However, because I use this set in a 1900 square foot, 2 story home most of the 50 feet cabling was not adequate for my needs so I did purchase nearly a thousand feet of additional cabling in order to place the cameras in my desired locales.<br />+Wired cameras > Wireless.  Trust me, I've used several other wireless kits in the past and while I loved the ease of setup and lack of cabling hassles I often encountered battery/power issues and inconsistent connectivity.<br />+The image quality of the included cams = Great!  The resolution is plenty sharp and the night vision modes are sharper than I expected with ample range illuminated in view.<br />+Really appreciate the weatherproof cameras that allows for greater placement options (eg - outdoor patio).<br />+Love the remote viewing capability.  The iPhone app works great and I find great joy in being able to peek at my dogs and children whilst away from home.<br /><br />Overall a very nice set with very well made and thought out components (they even include a mouse and remote control for utilization with the DVR interface).  My only wish is the inclusion of longer cables because as it is right out of the box the kit seems designed for small, 1 room type businesses and will require a bit more investment for proper placement in homes.",11/24/2013

To begin with, it isn't exactly easy to install.  Be prepared for some planning and drilling, since the cameras are all wired, but it is all worth it.  The DVR is nearly silent, so you can place it just about anywhere.  I used an old computer monitor with it, but it has an HDMI output, so you could just connect it to your TV.  After setting that up (which is super easy), you need to mount the cameras.  The tilt and pan camera is amazing.  Once you mount it, you can control it even with the smartphone apps (I used the iPhone one).  The other cameras mount in a fixed position, so I put the pan and tilt in the center of my main living area, placing the fixed ones down the hall, and one outside facing the driveway (yes they're weatherproof!).  After setting up the system, I decided to play with the clarity and night vision.  If you've seen Ghost Hunters, you know what you're working with.  What amazed me was the clarity of the night vision.  I wrote \\""can you read this?\\"" on a piece of paper and placed it on the table about 15 feet from the main camera.  I turned off the lights, and I could read it easily in the complete darkness!<br /><br />I don't live in a high crime area, but I like being able to check on the home while away.

Recently when we had visitors at the cabin and some noises were heard outside.

The paper is a bit on the heavy side and the support pole does sag just a little, but I expect that I'll be hanging backgrounds on this stand for a long time.  One thing that concerns me about this stand is the construction of the &#34;crossbar&#34;.  It's a two piece bar that's held together via a bolt at the center.  Although I haven't used this system long enough to get any data, I suspect that over time the joint may weaken which could lead to failure.  The stands each come with flimsy carrying/storage bags as well, but these bags offer little protection.  I would have liked to have paid slightly more for a sturdy bag that holds all 4 pieces.

At 28mm pull it out one notch, at 35mm or more extend it all the way. It works! If this is too much bother for you, at 28mm and above pull it out all the way, there will be very slight cropping necessary when you cross that focal range (28-33mm apx) and you can see it in your viewfinder and adjust easily.<br /><br />Works as above on Nikkor 18-300 f3.5 - 5.6 and Nikkor 17-55 f2.8<br /><br />Not good for Nikkor 12-24 till 15mm and after.The photo will be in a slight circle from 12-15mm<br /><br />Actually I love this hood, easier to pack, stays on the lens securely and it adds better (bouncy) protection to the lens - rather than a hard jolt from metal or plastic.

It was not as long as plastic hood that came with my 85-mm f/1.4G Nikon  with lens, but it seems to be long enough and is more convenient as it folds. The rubber is a little too thick and bulky for my taste (could be actually good for protection from impact), and it is a little hard to invert the lens completely backwards for storage/transportation. The hood does folds on itself (not backwords) for a reduced profile. German made-in-Korea Keiser 3-in-1 rubber hood is much more elegant and flexible, but is 4 times more expensive. The rubber is not permamently attached to the metal ring (like Kaiser hood). If you pull the rubber on this cheap hood to the sides, it can get detached (it is not glued), but it can be popped back in with some efforts. Not really an issue, if you do not force it. I would recommend this hood if you want to have the hood, but do not like handling and carrying the plastic hood and do not want to spring for a much more expensive rubber hood.",1/25/2014

I bought the lens used, so no hood. From the pictures I've seen of the hood that comes with this lens new, it would have been difficult to put it in my camera bag along with the other gear. This gives me a smaller item, for easier storage.<br /><br />It of course has the threads for attaching the hood to the lens, but also threads for attaching a filter to the hood. So with the hood being collapsible, you could use a Polarizer or a variable ND filter. Collapse the hood to make your adjustment, and then extend the hood for your shot. The extended rubber is 3mm thick, and where the hood collapses it's thinner so it will collapse. Hopefully that will hold up for awhile.<br /><br />I went out shooting today using the hood, and to my surprise using the 10-24mm lens on a full frame camera, the hood gave the lens tunnel vision, even at 24mm. Without the hood I get vignetting on the sides at 10mm, but the vignetting goes away starting at 13mm. Now I get the effect of looking down a tube until 24mm, then the vignetting is just on the sides. For a crop sensor camera, this is a different story. On a 1.6x crop sensor camera, the focal length now becomes 16-35mm. So the tunneling is still there at 16mm, but quickly goes away as you increase your focal length.<br /><br />Now for me this is cool. I'm a big fan of fish-eye lenses, and this hood gives a neat effect. For this kind of money, how can you go wrong.",2/26/2015

You can hear the loud \\""click\\"" when it goes into position.  It is not difficult to remove, but requires enough effort to confirm it is not going to fall off in use.<br /><br />I have not withheld any stars because of the price.  It is what is right now; if the camera is popular enough, hopefully there will be knockoffs at a fraction of the price in the future.<br /><br />One reason for buying the lens hood was protection of the lens from bumps and knocks.  I know some prefer to do this with a filter, but for reasons mentioned below, that was not my choice.<br /><br />Another reason was keeping rain drops off the lens.  With other cameras, this is not a problem because they can't be used in the rain, but  the S1 is sealed and I expect it will be used on wet days.<br /><br />A third consideration was reduction of glare and lens flare, but I have not found that to be much of a problem in the past.<br /><br />Protection of the lens and keeping rain drops off the lens were the primary considerations.<br /><br />You can use the center pinch lens cap that ships with the camera when the lens hood is in place.  But you cannot use a filter.  The lens cap is 55 mm.<br /><br />If you want to use a filter, you buy the AR-S1 filter ring, a step-up ring, which enables the use of a 72 mm filter, plus the filter.  But if you use a filter, you cannot have a lens hood or a lens cap.  The camera's lens is not 72mm and a 72mm lens cap is much too large.  The diameter of a 72mm lens cap or filter is about 1/2 wider than the lens.<br /><br />If I find in the future that I really want a filter for specific shooting situations, I will buy the filter ring and desired filter, e.g., polarizer, and remove the lens hood for the time the filter is needed.  But, to me, the lens hood does more for me than the filter for general use, and that was why I chose it.",4/4/2014

It allows you to turn/rotate your GoPro 360 degrees once it's mounted. There are already the normal mounting connectors that allow you to move your GoPro back and forth or side to side. However, this is the only mount that I've seen which allows you to spin your GoPro around 180 degrees to now be facing the other direction on a mount such as the suction cup mount. I previously would mount my GoPro for example on a helmet extension mount. Sometimes though I'd want the GoPro facing me and sometimes I'd want it facing forward for a POV shot. However, previously I would have to unscrew the GoPro from the helmet extenstion arm to turn it 180 degrees to get the other angle. With this ball joint I can simply turn the GoPro where I need it. There are already other basic GoPro accessories that allow you to tilt the GoPro forward and backward and side to side. Yes this ball joint alone won't allow the GoPro to go side to side but with the addition of a 90 degree connector which should have came with every GoPro you now can move your GoPro in any direction without the need to ever re-mount the GoPro. This is the product I have been looking for as this was a frustration I've had with the lack of ability to rotate my GoPro around previously.",4/24/2014

Thst is angle up and down, as well as side to side. So, I figured this mount with the ball joint would allow that...but it does not. It only allows adjustment forward and back.<br />So, what is the point of having the ball adjustment???  The standard mount thst came eith the go pro can do that.  I could probably take this mount apart and attack it with my Dremel tool to add side to side tilt adjustment...but there are other better options.<br /><br />So, since the primary reason for the ball joint is typically to provide multi-dimension rotation adjustment, this did not meet my needs.",4/17/2014

I used this to record a friends music videos.  The sound is surprisingly OK.  The images turned out quite nice.  This is a good consumer camera.  I do not like the fact that you may need special software to upload some files and that software does not work with windows XP.  Also I lost the disc or else I never received one.  There is no sound input other than the microphone.  For steady shots at long zoom you will need a tripod.  Also extra batteries are too expensive.  This is not a camera to take for a week long off the grid adventure.  But it holds a charge for an afternoon of capturing videos without a hitch and it recharges easily.  The touch screen zoom control is much smoother than the top switch control.  It took me a few tries before I figured that out.  You must purchase an SD card there is no internal memory.  I have not yet explored the wifi features of this camera so look to another review for that.  It fits easily in a large pocket and is light enough that you wont get tired of holding it up.  I gave it four stars for a good consumer cam with a star taken off because of some file transfer issues.  Uploading a large high quality file to youtube with a slower connection takes a very long time.  So plan your files accordingly.  Also I did notice interleaving effect on some files.  Just choose the quality level accordingly.  Overall it works well and if you use it a lot you will find the perfect settings for your needs.  And it is fun to zoom into and out of scenes.,6/19/2014

I use video cameras for tennis matches and it is nice to be able to see what it sees from the ground. Also it has a cool feature that will keep the image level even if you have the camera skewed a bit. Those two features work as described however...<br /><br />The Bad:<br />I bought this expecting it to have threads on the front to accept a wide angle. Unfortunately it has no threads. Of course this will not matter for 99% of consumers but if it does matter then you want to get the HC-V720 which will allow you to add another lens or filter. The V720 also has a better image sensor according to the review websites.<br />One other bad is the fact that right now there are no 3rd party batteries and the extended Panasonic one cost $125.00! Since the battery it comes with lasts only about an hour you should plan on adding another battery if you need to shoot for more than an hour.,9/12/2013

I love the long zoom.  It says \\""HD\\"", but it's not (it's more like 480).  I wanted to get an upgrade this year and decided on the V520 (80x) instead of the new V201 (only 38x).  I still wanted the extra zoom.  I need to purchase at least a 32GB card because of the larger files.  The battery is also small, but you can buy extras.  The part numbers are VW-VBT190 (which comes in the box) or VW-VBT380.  I did a side by side test with the V10, and the V520 clarity at 80X is awesome!  I am so excited to have this upgraded camera.<br /><br />To be very clear, I am sure there are better cameras in the 1X to 16X range.  I wanted to be able to zoom in on someone's face from at least 100 yards away.  This will do it without having to do digital zoom.  Also, the long optical zoom with the *optical* stabilization makes for a great hand held or monopod camera.<br /><br />There are lots of other interesting features like the smartphone integration/remote viewing/remote control.  But for me, long distance, stabilized, high def video is what I wanted.  I upload to Youtube and share with the family and friends.  It's perfect for what I need.  As an added bonus, the stills are great.  The V10 photos were .5 megapx (point five!) while the V520 is optical zoom and stabilized at 10 megapx.

I looked for, but couldn't find a way to use a PC, rather than a smartphone to see/control while on wifi.<br />It is a great shame though that it, together with loads of cameras currently, has no longer got the good old fashioned IR remote option (Inclusion/retainment of that feature would have only added pennies), which has greater reliability, also would allow for specialist applications e.g. to be operated in other rooms via IR extenders.<br />Come on Panasonic, please offer IR remote or wired remote as an affordable retrospective upgrade, also for the V720 and the camcorders would as far as I am concerned get a 5 star for shear versatility.",11/5/2013

The other problem is that the zoom is touchy.

I'm currently learning how to create videos, so the price I paid to enter my learning curve has been reasonable.<br /><br />Currently, I do not use my camera for interviews, so for sound, I record with an H2next Handy Recorder - Zoom, which I adore.<br /><br />Given that I think this is a terrific entry-level recorder, here are your considerations if you aim for something better. 1) you'll have to examine your sound needs, especially if you are doing interviews. You might need a better camera and more equipment to achieve what you want. Note that recording sound directly into your computer (of any type) produces poor quality. 2) the zoom device does not expand or retract smoothly. You can achieve it somewhat smoothly if you use a lot of concentration, however, if smooth zooming (by this I mean, your hand does not twitch when changing its range), you will have to spend a lot more, and 3) bright sun makes the viewing screen difficult to see. A video camera with protected viewfinder might be what you need, but you'll pay a lot for this. If you have the cash, go for the investment. If not, just \\""make it work.\\""<br /><br />I'm currently designing a light-weight, cardboard hood for use of the camera's screen during bright daylight. Otherwise, I just guess at what I see, which is often good enough. I've been using digital cameras since they first came out and I am used to guessing.<br /><br />Frankly, the biggest learning curve is not in taking videos, but using video composition software. My understanding is that composition is easy on Mac-related equipment, although it might be based 100% on templates. I am using CyberLink PowerDirector 12, which has a fairly steep learning curve only because it offers so many creative options. I think PowerDirector is absolutely awesome and don't mind that I had to spend some time learning how to use it. I now understand what isgoing on behind the scenes in professional videos because of it. Studying to be a pro? And you are only 12? Ask your parents to buy this for you. Are you 25 and hoping to change your profession? I recommend the same. And you are any other age and want to move forward before taking classes and becoming a video equipment junky? I offer the same advice.<br /><br />Next, if you are planning on doing something other than just showing a running video, video script writing is also challenging. So is learning how to piece together fragments of information, from still photography, your own hand-made-designs, and video portions. Spend a month or so on PowerDirector and force yourself  to use all of its features. Once you are over the steep entry-level learning curve, you'll feel you are well on your way to becoming a pro.<br /><br />Is the video this camera produces better than what you can do on a smart phone? The two things that make a difference is its telephoto lens and its internal stabilizer. This not to say that you should use your smart phone for everything, but if you do, that is what you will be losing.<br /><br />Now then, this video camera also takes stills. These stills are not as crisp as what you'd get from a standard digital camera and, frankly, they are not useful if what you need are great photos. This feature is useful, however, if you need to take snap-shots of a scene to help you develop a storyboard and, because of the 50x telephoto, it will help you see what you cannot see with the naked eye. It's a great feature as long as you know what you need to use it for.<br /><br />I have not used the camera's presets yet and will experiment in the future. For my current needs, the ability to turn it off and on easily fits the bill.",4/6/2014

All the reviews said it was the best way to go in my price range including Consumer Reports. However, I am completely underwhelmed. Here's my take:<br /><br />1) Sharpness - Terrible. In the brightest light, it is average at best. For comparison, my Galaxy S3 is a sharper in bright light which is crazy. This was the #1 complaint in all the reviews out there and they are right. It just isn't sharp.<br /><br />2) Low light - Bad. When the light goes down, the sensor struggles and you get a blurry and noisy video. I did a side by side with the Galaxy S3 and the S3 was MUCH, MUCH sharper in indoor lighting scenarios around the house.<br /><br />3) Auto-Focus - Average? The reason I can't be sure of the quality of the auto-focus is because with it being so weak in terms of sharpness, how can I say how well it hit focus. It would hit focus if a face was in the frame and took up a good 25+% of the frame, but otherwise, it was just vague.<br /><br />4) Image Stabilization - Decent. The feature definitely appeared to work pretty well. Hand shake is one of the main reasons I get annoyed shooting with a cell phone and this camera did a decent job handling this.<br /><br />5) Sound - Decent. I'm not a sound expert, so I can't say how good it is compared to other cameras, but it seemed decent enough.<br /><br />6) User Interface - Terrible. This touch interface infuriated me non-stop. If you want something more than the absolute bare bones minimum, this isn't the camera for you. It was just annoying to use in almost every way. It allowed me to pick my video type and review it, but everything was just a bit more annoying than it could have been.<br /><br />7) Zoom - Great. This has a nice wide angle lens with plenty of zoom on the telephoto side. But why do I need a blurry 50x zoom? It will look awful.<br /><br />Overall if you have a modern smartphone, this camera won't be an upgrade for you. I'm just so disappointed in what this camera brought to the table. Maybe I got a defective unit. For Panasonic's sake, I hope so as I just can't accept what I am seeing as what all these other people are considering to be \\""good.\\""<br /><br />Update: I also tried a Canon R400 for comparison. So far, I can say that the R400 has the Panasonic beat in every category except zoom. Canon is sharper in good light and is much better at autofocusing. The image stabilization seems to be a touch better than Panasonic although both were decent. The User Interface on the Canon is better for sure. The R400's wide angle is a bit lacking sadly. If Canon would get it closer to 32mm on the wide side instead of 38mm, it would be a great camera. There are some nice things about the Panasonic that you don't get in the Canon R400, but for the price gap, you would expect that.<br /><br />To the manufacturers: Please stop shrinking the pixel size. We as consumers don't need 20MP stills from our video camera and 80x zoom. I know marketing loves to have the biggest numbers, but what we need and want is less noisy and sharper HD Video. Increase those sensor sizes!",11/11/2013

You can use the white and silver/black layers together or either individually.  So you can have a white umbrella for bounce or through lighting, a silver umbrella, or a white umbrella with silver backing.  Not sure if the silver backing increases the efficiency of the umbrella.  It does take some struggle to get the layers on-and-off, as you have to individually remove them from the spokes.  Also, the material is not stretched out snugly when the umbrella is open.  The shaft fits fine in my AlienBee's monolight's umbrella slot, as well as in my speedlight clamps.<br /><br />The transparent vinyl cover probably won't last very long.  Then again, the umbrella itself isn't very sturdy, but I didn't expect much for $30 and I am happy with what I received, if only the dimensions were correct.  I've decided to keep it and find some way to attach it to the outside of my lighting bag, which I'm sure won't improve it's chances for long-term survival.<br /><br />I haven't used this yet for any photos.  When I do if I see any problems I'll update this review.",3/11/2015

The ballhead included with my Manfrotto travel tripod was kinda flimsy, and this Calumet is a far better substitute.  It holds up even my husky Canon T90 film SLR with no complaints.  The quick-release lever locks open when you flip it out and remove the plate or whatever it's attached to, and all you have to do to mount something is pop it down on the mounting base, and the lever locks into place -- very neat.  The built-in level is great for those of us who shoot film, since it's often hard to gauge level by looking for the finder -- or at least it is for me.  (It's much easier to use live view on a digital, or at least I find it so.)<br /><br />My favorite feature by far with this Calumet ballhead is the panoramic panning functionality.  I like shooting stitched panoramas, and this head lets me do that more precisely than I'm otherwise able to.  Angles are marked in ten-degree increments with numbers every 30 degrees, which is nice.<br /><br />The only downside is that it's kinda heavy, but that's the price you pay for good support, and it's a chunk of metal, so it's not likely you'll need to worry overly much about wear and tear. I've not tested the stated 26-pound holding capacity since I'd be leery of putting much more than 6 or 7 pounds on my current set of legs, but it quite easily holds any camera and lens I'm likely to stick on it.",8/26/2015

Dumb...but learn from experience. I taped the wires to a string(not the ends) when I pulled them back out, taped up the ends so they wouldn't get caught. Maybe this is why the connectors are so sensitive. If I bump my dvr, I loose the picture. So I just wiggle them again to get picture back. I would recommed to the manufacturer to have a connector at each end that you can take the ends off when pulling wires. Then plug the different ends back in.

I was looking for an all in one lens solution because I wanted to make life easier for me.  I paired this Nikon lens with my Nikon D5300 and it works great.  This lens has the range I was looking for and takes good quality images.  Now the lens doesn't take the same quality of image as my Nikon 50mm prime lens, but most of my photography situations do not need a prime lens.  For now, this lens will be the one on my camera 90% of the time and my 50mm prime lens the other 10%.  This will greatly reduce the need for carrying and switching lenses, and reduce the chances of getting dirt in my equipment . The only nitpick I have is that the lens feels a bit heavier than I anticipated (probably a good thing in terms of equipment quality).  For me, my D5300 is a lightweight small camera body and this lens is fairly heavy, so the pair together seems unbalanced and a bit awkward at times.  By no means a deal breaker, just something I noticed.  Overall, I am very happy with this lens.",9/9/2014

I have shot them on the same body under the same lighting conditions and I could not tell any differences in softness at 200mm.  I tried and couldn't decide which was which.  It's a heavier lens, made with more metal than plastic compared to the 55-200.  I say that to say that it seems like a &#34;nicer&#34; lens based on price, and it is.

I recently added Nikon to my collection and started with the 16-85mm as well as the stock 18-55mm. I purchased the D3100 to complement the d40 and d80 and wanted a one Camera/lens combo for all around traveling with the d3100. I purchased this on Craigslist for $225, it is the first version and made in Taiwan. I expected only good sharpness with some drop off at longer focal lengths, but what I got REALLY surprised me! this lens is VERY GOOD from 18-135mm and good at 200mm. I tested it against my Excellent 16-85mm and it really holds up well. The 16-85 SLIGHTLY edges it out in resolution, but you really have to look very close at the edges to see it, nothing you would ever notice in real life shooting. The 16mm vs 18mm is also a small difference, I prefer this lens overall because of the added zoom range to 200mm vs 85mm. this benefit outweighs the 16mm wide benefits. I wont be going back to Canon anytime soon for my non-pro uses, Canon consumer lenses simply cannot compare.  Update -after shooting for a few months I did notice that the edges fall apart when shoot from a distance and have a fuzzy glow to them beyond 100mm. The 16-85mm and 18-105mm are sharper",1/8/2015

Superb piece of glass. Never had any issues with it. Newer one has a lock on it (to keep it in 18mm position) and I can see myself using it, my lens could open and &#34;start to zoom&#34; when gravity does its thing. Other then that - no issues.<br /><br />And it survived my bike accident when I flipped over a bike. Almost broke both arms, but lens had only a scuff on the bottom lip where you screw on the hood.

The lens is wide enough to shoot a bedroom for a home sale, and has almost enough zoom for the kids' soccer pics. I once shot a lunar eclipse, and saw this bright &#34;star&#34; in the frame. On closer examination, it had straight edges and an odd shape - probably the Space Station. Pretty exciting to have picked that up with a regular camera lens. Of course you probably give up some definition for that flexibility, but this serves amateur purposes as I define them. Cautions: (a) It doesn't do macro very well: you need a minimum subject distance of about a metre, and a $200 Canon Powershot or even a Blackberry often take better close-ups. (b) The lens or hood can get in the way of the built-in flash, happens on all longer lenses particularly when extended. (c) You have to turn the bezel the &#34;wrong&#34; way to zoom in/out. But that's like driving in UK - you get used to it soon enough. (d) When pointed down, there's enough weight on the screw that it unravels the lens (screws the lens out, zooming in, no damage, but more likely to bump into stuff).

I went down below the house and set up to take a few pictures of Mt. Hood as we can see it from across the street. You will need a pack mule, 3 teen age kids, and a wagon to pack the tripod lens and body. I have a 4 wheeled cart I use to transport from the parking spot to race site behind my mountain bike so I can do it myself. I use a Manfrotto 055 tripod with a 504HD pan head as I shoot moving targets and wanted a head for that. 28 pounds or so total for the setup, more time at the gym I guess.<br /><br />The lens is what I expected on my EOS 7D so I am at 460mm instead of 300. It was a little warm today with a fair amount of moisture in the air as they are still irrigating the cherry trees. It picked up all the haze and most of the mountain at 300mm. We are about 45 miles from the mountain and I could not get it all in frame. I did not find it soft on either end, nor did I see any real problems with the focus being slow as some have complained about. The trees in the foreground are well defined at 300mm.<br /><br />After I loaded my photos on the laptop I saw the first 3 shots had a pronounced \\""dust spot\\"" just to the left of the mountain flank, thought it was on the screen at first. After looking at it magnified it was a crow at about 1 mile and it was razor sharp in outline. I know it is a mile because the 2 orchard blocks are about 1 mile long total and it was a little past them. You can really tell it is a large black bird. I spent a couple of minutes looking at the shots I took and was impressed at the clarity and resolution. At 800 you can actually see some rock features of the mountain. Impressive to say the least. Yes, at 80 degrees you can see the air convection from the heat at long distances. A really less than optimal test, but realistic conditions for the ColumbiaRiver Gorge in Oregon. The polarizer got rid of some of the haze, but not all.<br /><br />Camera shake is a problem as we had a 5-10mph breeze and I could see just the slightest movement as I was setting up for the shots. I may have to use a full size sensor camera for this lens as it may be too long at 300mm for where I sit. I look forward to fall/winter when the air cools and clears to really see what Mt. Hood looks like at the house.<br /><br />My first impression was complete satisfaction in the purchase. The second impression was feeling how old I am packing this thing around! I have wanted this lens for over 5 years, I could not ask for a more perfect gift than to see a dust spot turn into a 2 or 3 pound bird at a mile. I did not even see it when I took the shots. I was shooting shutter preferred at 1/1000 to about 1/3000 with ISO and aperature set by the camera. Shooting conditions for me at the race site.<br /><br />I wish I had bought this lens 5 years ago. I see how it got the name \\""SigMonster\\"". It is not a lens for point and shoot and if you expect that you may as well buy a point and shoot camera as you will be disappointed. I started with a Canon F1 and a couple of lenses back in the 70's, A2E in the 90's, and digital just 3 years ago.<br /><br />UPdate:8/2/13<br /><br />Used it last weekend and was impressed with the results. Color is outstanding. Used a 46mm \\""Moose Polarizer\\"" modified by me to fit the filter holder all weekend. Chucked it up in a lathe and made it a little bit thinner to fit the lens. I doubt it will ever leave the holder. Lens requires a bit of a learning curve but it performs very well on 180mph boats. It is HEAVY!!!",7/21/2013
US,10949028,RTQ8FVAJT06SA,B0009JKH78,920166,Sigma 300-800mm f/5.6 EX DG APO HSM Lens,Camera,4,16,17,N,N,Best Value - Super-Duper Telephoto lens with Zoom to boot,"I have owned this lens now for one year.  For most people, this is not a lens that one shoots with everyday, so it does not get the same amount of use as more typical lenses; 16-35, 24-70, 700-200 etc.<br /><br />First, the downside of this lens:<br /><br />It is big, quite big and heavy.  Tracking it around, say in the woods, wet marshland, waters edge, where footing is not always ideal is not as easy as one might expect by just looking at the &#34;weight&#34; of it.  It does require a good, heavy duty tripod and head.  While I use a Manfrotto CF pod and their pseudo gimbal (which I actually prefer over my now former Wimberly), expect to spend close to another $1K on tripod and head if you do not already have a suitable duty one.  Then plan to track this equipment along with you as well.<br /><br />Next issue is that it lacks OS/IS or VR (image stabilization).  Is this a big issue?  It varies by person as their opinion on that.  For much of what I use this lens for, it's lack of this feature is less noticeable.  Though I have to be honest, I think it would be nice if it did have it!<br /><br />Final negative:  at 800mm it is operating in it's weakest performance point.  I try to keep my shooting to 700mm and find I get better results in all regards.  The 800mm is usable, great to have if/when needed.<br /><br />Those &#34;negative's&#34; aside, I really do like this lens and the zoom aspects of it.  I have 3 other telephoto or long telephoto lenses (300 2.8 IS, 400 5.6 for hiking, 500mm non-IS - all by Canon).  The beauty of the Sigma is the zoom allows me to tiringly take this single lens for a day of wildlife shooting (from a tele perspective) and really have all my bases covered.  I find that any image quality I give up by using this lens vs. any of the above Canon lenses is very minimal and if not side by side, unnoticeable.<br /><br />Does it focus as fast as the above referenced Canons?  I would say based on my experiences is that any differences in focus speed are unnoticeable at 700mm or less.  My missed focus shots are typically a result of operator error and not putting my focus point where it should be (on the subject), which of course is not the lenses fault.<br /><br />Do I get a lower keeper rate with this lens than the above referenced Canon lenses?  Yes.  But I attribute that to the increased focal length I typically shoot at.  My keeper rate between the 300mm Canon to the 500mm Canon also results in a reduced keeper rate.  The longer focal length, the tougher technically it is to shoot successfully.<br /><br />Can this lens take stunning, great detailed, in focus, saturated pictures?  Absolutely.<br /><br />Will you get stunning, highly detailed, in focus pictures?  Probably not at first, unless you have experience shooting a full size 500, or 600mm lens.  The importance of good technique increases along with the focal length.  Practices that may be less than perfect may work with a 200 or 300mm lens, but they won't with a 600-800mm lens.  Keep that in mind and if you do buy one, make a point to practice often when you first get it, especially if you are buying it for a special trip!<br /><br />In my opinion, this may be one of the best values in a super telephoto lens for somebody who wants it all, but also lives in the real world and is not paid for their photography.  This lens in a professional's hands will produce print results that are indistinguishable from the Canon 600 or 800mm lenses.",8/22/2014

It wasn't easy saving up for it. At first I started making my lunch at home instead of eating out, then I would only drink water when i went out to a bar with the fellas, but sadly i still wasn't saving fast enough to purchase this lens. So i started to donate blood every two days as a means to accumulate money faster, and when I realized i still wasn't getting to my goals i started to donate sperm at the local sperm bank.

My first was their basic manual camera and as the years progressed, I stayed with Pentax.  Why?  Because I collected accessories that were Pentax.

I used to have a Canon PowerShot SX30 IS, and while that was a very nice camera for a beginner, now that I'm getting more into photography this K-30 is quite pleasing.  I decided to go Pentax due to their reputation for building sturdy cameras (I have a 2 year old daughter who WILL get her hands on it from time to time).  I also got a trial of Adobe Lightroom 5 to really learn the developing process.  I leave the white balance on auto and shoot RAW, the camera seems to pick a very close white balance by itself but it's certainly easy to edit later.  The dynamic range seems quite decent, I've shot a few sunrise pictures and I was really able to bring out the details in the shadows.<br /><br />My camera came with the 18-55 DA L and the 55-300 DA L.  They seem fine, supposedly they are pretty decent for kit lenses.  I don't think they are 'tack sharp,' not that I know precisely what to look for, but they do seem to be able to capture fairly sharp images.  They are not weather resistant, but the body is.  I will have to get a weather-resistant lens later for light rain type stuff.<br /><br />Looking through the viewfinder I saw a speck of dirt or something.  It did not come out in the images, so later I figured out that it was on the 'focusing screen,' and I was able to clean it off with a cleaning kit.  Otherwise great camera out of the box.

The Time.txt file was making camera act as if battery wasn't charged. But removing file fixed it. Field of view is pretty good Although,.. the camera is fixed to left side, so the TVscreen edge stops basically in line with the extended left ear arm and right of that, meaning it's best to have subject matter you are filming directly in front and or more on your right side. Pros... It works and picture quality is good. Cons... Battery life is horrible... Filming in low light is not good. DIRECT Bright light also effects the filming white out style.

The tutorial shows how to enter video and photo modes but it doesn't explain how to start recording a video.<br /><br />The built quality is poor. It seems that when I pull out the card after finishing recording, there are corrupt video files. I try to wait for about 30 seconds after the final video recorded but it doesn't help.

Had these over a month ago so I could record myself fishing from a POV (point of view), not as good a quality as my GoPro ($499) but bang for my buck it has been a good product.    Good Points    1. Good value for money.    2. You don't have to purchase a memory card 8 gig memory card is already provided.    3. 720p recording is of very good quality.    4. Product is covert you cant notice the camera at all, proper spy glasses this is were I believe it truly stands out.    5. Very nice package comes in a box and you also get a carry case for your camera glasses    Bad Points    1. Not so easy to operate from the get go, I contacted the supplier who was very helpful to guide me to the website cams4today.com which has all the video tutorials for the product, I recommend you watch them if you get stuck and all FAQ, once I understood it recording and taking snap shots were straight forward.    2.

IΓÇÖve been unable to get some items recognized by my computer, something is wrong with the design/engineering/manufacturing, or there is a general frustration in figuring out how to operate some of them.<br />With respect to the build:  ΓÇ£adequateΓÇ¥ for their intended usage; probably on the delicate side, but if you donΓÇÖt abuse them, they should work out.  Lens are clear with a slight tint, which gives them the appearance of ΓÇ£coatedΓÇ¥ lenses.  As for ΓÇ£styleΓÇ¥, I guess I would say ΓÇ£acceptableΓÇ¥.  They wouldnΓÇÖt be my choice in an optometristΓÇÖs shop, but ΓÇ£styleΓÇ¥ is a personal/subjective criteria,  anyway.  They certain donΓÇÖt look ΓÇ£fakeΓÇ¥.  In fact, in the several environments I used them around people, nobody gave a second glance.<br />Usage:  Instructions are in a translation from Chinese (presumably) to English.  But the instructions are more clear than usual with these things.  My computer, using Windows 7, readily recognized and saved files upon downloading with the supplied USB wire.  A USB card was already installed and the glasses were ready to use after a 2-3 hour charge (using the USB wire connected to my desktop).  IΓÇÖm not sure what class of micro sd card is in the glasses.  I havenΓÇÖt tried to remove it and check.  IΓÇÖm guessing that it is a class 4.  IΓÇÖm also guessing that a class 10 might provide slightly better recording.  There is only 1 button on the glasses.  No others.  1 button controls everything.  You only need to remember the LED light sequences or carry a ΓÇ£cheat sheetΓÇ¥.<br />Quality of Recording:  IΓÇÖm not eager to confirm that these glasses record video in HD.  That said, I found the recording quality acceptable for the price and the fact that they are not professional quality.  They are strictly ΓÇ£consumerΓÇ¥ grade.  I tried them outside, in a couple of well lit stores, and a in a darker sports bar atmosphere.  I was able to record in all environments without a problem.  The audio was much better than I expected.  I will note that if you are ΓÇ£panningΓÇ¥ as you turn your head, anything other than very, very slow movement on your part will result in some blurred sequences.  However, if you are holding your head relatively still, the captures will be quite goodΓÇöand will approach HD that you are expecting.  The glasses capture color quite well.  Not saturated, but not faded either.  True  colors.<br /><br />The seller, Cams4today, has a website that has 3 short videos called tutorials.  They might be helpful if you have problems understanding the printed instructions.<br /><br />I give it 4 stars instead of 5 just due to the blurred effect if I turn my head faster than a turtle might.  Other than that, and the lack of competing products with clear lens, IΓÇÖm quite satisfied with the purchase.",3/18/2015

(Still!!!!),"Great little tripod - folds down to nothing and easily attaches to my backpack.  I have had this tripod for a year now - purchased it on Amazon as part of a bundle (LensPen, blower, etc).  It has held up and has &#34;traversed&#34; the US with me - from Yosemite to DC.<br /><br />First - this is not my regular tripod - I use it only for travel because of its size and weight.  I took a $100 gamble and it paid off.  It can easily support a DSLR with a 200mm 2.8 lens without ball head creep.  Only thing (as said in another review) is hold your camera when loosening the ball head friction knob - it will flop-over rather quickly - no matter what camera/lens combo you are using.<br /><br />Something else I found - the 10 pound limit is &#34;The Limit&#34;.  I had a camera mounted and added weight to the hook - it was close to 11 pounds (my backpack being the weight) and the legs started to retract.  I removed a couple items from the bag and reset the legs - not a problem.  The ball head was stable.  Later, I weighed the camera and bag - that is how I got the 11 pound mark.  With the same items removed (as previously) - was around 9 pounds.  Someone did their factory testing.<br /><br />Another item - with the center column fully extended - it is a little shaky (I never use the column - even with my main tripod - I find a long column a hindrance more than an assistant.<br /><br />All of that being said - why five stars?  It is just that reliable for me.<br /><br />I am planning to take this tripod with me on a few trips this year and have no reservations about it - fantastic bang-for-the-buck - excellent for travel.  If it were lost/stolen/damaged - I would definitely get another one.<br /><br />Update---I have now had this tripod for 3 1/2 years.  My camera and lenses have been upgraded (heavier), The tripod has been across the US a few times so it has quite a few scars from airports, slot canyons, rock walls, drops...  It is still my go-to for travels when my full-sizedtripod can't go with me.  There is no wear on the leg locks or ballhead.  When I lock the legs, they stay locked.  Same with the ballhead...no looseness in any of the joints of the tripod.  Yes - I have had to re-tighten the hex screws where the legs attach to the spider but - that is to be expected with as much use as this tripod has received.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this tripod for the traveler and would still - if it was lost/stolen/damaged get a new one asap.",4/9/2015

This tripod seems to have it all:  very light (I carried it all over Tokyo), compact (fits into the water bottle pocket on my Lowepro backpack), solid for an extremely light aluminum tripod, has a hook to hang a weight to stabilize it further.  It has a bubble level, but that is easily concealed by the quick-release shoe that you screw into your camera. So it probably serves better to get the head in the ballpark of level.  I use the built-in levels in the OM-D.<br /><br />The TR553 stands about 4 feet, maximum, but gives a solid platform for the Olympus OM-D EM5 (coupled with an average m4/3 lens like the Panasonic 20mm f1.7 or the 12-50mm zoom). The ball head feels secure and doesn't seem to drift.  Some have complained about its tendency to suddenly flop down 90 degrees, but you just have to take care when loosening the friction knob.  I have not tried the head with an SLR/zoom combination (I don't own one), so I cannot comment on stability with heavier systems.<br /><br />If I could change anything, I would change the way that the legs lock.  Because there are four friction collars on each leg, they take a &#34;lot&#34; of time to deploy. About 20% of the time, I get confused and turn them the wrong way, making it take even longer.  It isn't that bad, but you end up deploying the tripod less often than you might otherwise.  A lever lock might be more convenient. Of course, if there were fewer segments in the legs, the tripod would not collapse to such a compact size.  Based on the size, weight, features and cost, I would buy this again. It is light enough to take as a &#34;just-in-case&#34; accessory.  While not cheap, it wouldn't kill me if someone stole it from checked luggage the way a carbon fiber one would.  For the price, it is amazingly well-built, a very nice-looking piece of equipment.<br /><br />Terrific travel tripod.",3/3/2014

If they gave people a better, stronger [and attached] way to use their lens caps, then they'll be sure to get glowing reviews. EforCity needs improved assembling of their products. It's a great-looking product and fits, but I only ordered it to have a lens cap that would be attachable to the camera: I did not think of asking -before buying- if I could see a photo of the other side where the &#34;paper-thin&#34; string is attached so I could also see where and how it comes attached. Despite the string being thin in the pic shown here, I wanted to believe my excitement about finding a lens cap that I could trust not to get lost...so my blind faith chose to &#34;ignore&#34; the photo they have beside or above their description. The item's poor (or insufficient) quality lies in the string being so thin it will UNDOUBTEDLY break, and was not really attached; so I'd be afraid to use it!! It's easy to assume it would fall off/ get lost.<br /><br />P.S. They're VERY nice, but for an even greater professional image, I told them they need to have someone more fluent in written English communication/ grammar in order to be clear and possibly ensure future customers will always be at ease.",7/10/2015

I stacked the +2 and +4 to get +6 without any loss of clarity. If +10 is not enough and you want to stack it, the +10 lens must be on top because the shape and thickness of the glass prevents another lens from screwing on top of it.<br /><br />Regarding the lenses, I can say they did not negatively affect the color or clarity of the flower that I was shooting.<br /><br />The lenses come in a nice case with a pocket for each lens. The pockets are not designated for any lens, but the strength is marked on the black plastic rim around the glass. For personal convenience, I marked each pocket with a felt marker.<br /><br />There may be better close up lens for more money, but this is a good budget set that may be all you need. At a minimum you will find out whether close up photography is something you want to pursue.

There were a few items that I had to stop and think about a little bit as I was installing the system.<br /><br />Monitor Install: The monitor ships with a stick on bracket that is meant to be stuck onto a dash. While this would be okay if you didn't have a system installed into your coach. It does not supply any other type of bracket for mounting of the monitor in the space of an existing monitor. This was kind of a problem, but I ended making a bracket using the parts from the one supplied and some good ole brain power.<br /><br />The Rear Camera: The instructions come with a diagram on how to splice the wires in the case of not being able to use the ones supplied. Like most motorhomes, they are built to not be taken apart, and routing wire through the ceiling was not an option here. I used the wires that were already in place for the old system, the only feature that I gave up was the ability to mirror the camera. Which was a big deal.<br /><br />The side Cameras: These were very easy to mount, although the instructions say &#34;bench test the system&#34; I agree, I hooked it up within the coach before I mounted the cameras and figured out which one worked on the correct side. Other reviews said the image was upside down because they did now perform this task.<br /><br />Pros: The system is very simple to hook up, it does require how to use basic tools. The image quality is very nice for the price,<br /><br />Cons: There could be a few more monitor choices for mounting the monitor, the instructions show other mounts although the instructions show other mounts none are supplied.",5/8/2015

The cabling and connectors are of the highest quality. I couldn't believe what I was getting for the money. The camera is awesome day and night. I haven't hooked up the backup light but haven't felt the need to have it because of the night vision. It's like the road behind me is lit up. We put 7,000 miles on the road with this camera. I didn't use so much for the backing up as I did using it to see what was behind me while driving. Works beautifully for lane changes. Just knowing what is back there or coming up in my blind spot is worth the cost of the system.<br /><br />The 7&#34; screen was a must have and I am not disappointed. I can see detail very well. I love the image mirroring capability as well as the easy to use controls on the face of the monitor. Getting a smaller screen makes little sense since the idea is to see what is behind you.<br /><br />I just bought a license plate camera to use on the second channel and am thinking about getting a camera mounted up on the front of the trailer to give me a better view of the road ahead and to see if I am going to hit anything when going down a tree covered one lane road.

I don't know if it was a manufacturing defect or that is just how the lens is produced.  First, the lens did not fit properly against the camera mount.  It was loose and would shift when zooming. Yes, I understand that sometimes there is a little give, but this was extreme and I was concerned over time it would cause damage to the camera body, it was noisy as well.  Also, it was very difficult to manually focus because the focus ring was extremely loose.  Personally, I was not crazy about the focus ring not having a hard stop either, that's just a personal preference though and I know others who like that.  Overall this absolutely did not meet my expectations.  That being said, however... Returning this product was exceptionally easy.

Coming from using an old Minolta 35-135 mm lens and an adapter, I miss the manual controls.<br /><br />Good:<br />The auto-focus in this lens is crazy quiet compared to the kit lens! I keep thinking that I left it on manual when I don't hear the focus motors moving.<br />It's quite an upgrade from the kit for those who need the zoom. As a 80-300 mm equivalent it really reaches out!<br />After shooting in the snow, this lens accumulated a little snow. Using a hood to protect the glass from snow, this lens performed without a hitch!<br /><br />Bad:<br />Aside from the glass, this lens is all plastic. The mount, the filter threads, the barrel; all plastic. Even the focus ring flexes a little under pressure.<br /><br />Ugly:<br />It's slow. With an f/4.0 at best you won't be taking any high speed, low light action shots! The auto-focus isn't super fast, but that's probably my camera's fault. (PEN E-PL1). When fully extended, it's not a pretty lens. literally.<br /><br />Recommend:<br />Yes I would recommend this lens particularly to a starting photographer. It provides that zoom that the kit lens can't at an affordable price. With lower ISO's and a tripod, excellent photos can be coaxed out of this lens.

A more capable photographer might get different results, but this lens is priced for the amateur, so here goes.<br /><br />This is a good-priced and a lightweight lens. It has a good zoom for getting portrait-like shots within 15 feet, but on a PEN EP-5 it likes to give me grainy, pixelated images unless the light is ideal. This is disappointing because on the screen the image looks great until you get a chance to zoom in and see the pixels. Then, the images in any &#34;just okay&#34; lighting situations break down.<br /><br />I have had very little luck using this lens with most of the artistic effects built into the camera without the image breaking up, too. I do not like the bokkeh effects it delivers no matter how the camera is set.<br /><br />I did not expect to be able to use this lens in a dark room, but even in medium well-lit places, it easily goes grainy.

I tested this lens on my Panasonic GX-7. Indoors, at short ranges (up to 15 yards or so) all shots were clean and ranged from very sharp to impressively sharp at all focal lengths. Outdoors, with a tripod, shots up to 30-35 yards ranged from very sharp at 40mm, to pretty sharp at 150mm. Very long shots (300-400 yards) were unimpressive, but I can't say with any certainty that this was a  lens problem. I used my standard tripod (but no cable release) which weighs about 3.5 pounds. I plan to re-do the long shots using an 8 pound tripod (a Benbo) and a cable release (at a cooler time of day, or better yet at night to rule out heat shimmer), and I'll update this review when/if I do. Overall, I'm very happy with the lens: color and contrast are excellent, focus accuracy is excellent (and manual focus is practical, seldom true for modern lenses). I took shots that should result in purple fringing - no fringing. And for a bonus, the (usually viewed as undesirable) all-plastic construction (except lens glass) results in a camera-lens combination that's light, well-balaced and very easy to carry. No, it's not a $1500 Leitz lens, but for the money it's a genuine miracle.<br />UPDATE 2016-03-30 This has become my go-to indoor portrait lens. It needs flash, way too slow a lens for available light indoors (I use a Nissin Di466FT flash, way bigger than the built-in, but I need the power, this is a slow lens) and don't get too far away from the subject. Using this lens at 45mm wide open I get wonderfully sharp portraits (it's too slow to blur the background, I have to choose my background carefully). It has its limitations, so do all lenses.

I highly recommend keeping continuity with Olympus cameras and Zuiko lenses, and believe it worth premium costs, as I can't sell a shoot that went bad. The ONLY thing to be considered on this lens is the max aperture of F. 4.0, which WILL limit any camera lens capability in several lower light or selective depth of field situations, so I don't recommend any such lens as an all-around solution, as you really do need something with F.1.8 to solve those field issues. One could start with this, so long as they are aware of the need for a shorter, wider aperture capability in near to immediate future.

Lets ignore cost.  I have compared it in detail to the olympus 70-300 (four thirds version) and the Panasonic 100-300mm.  At 150mm, there is no doubt that both the 70-300 and 100-300 are better.  However if you look at the 70-130mm range there is very little difference.  At 100mm the 40-150mm is just as good if not better in terms of sharpness.  The 40-150mm gets you the shorter telephoto focal lengths between 40-100mm, which are perfect for portraits and general photography.  It focuses very quickly and accurately.  The main advantage of this lens is that it is tiny compared to other telephoto lenses which are longer like the 100-300.

So far, I am very pleased with it; images look great, lens is affordable, it's lightweight... I also have the 12-50 and 25 1.8 which are both great lenses (5 of 5 stars.) Focal range aside, this lens feels a little different from them mainly in build quality. Let me start by saying I think the build quality is fine. This one feels cheaper. It has a plastic mount, feels less solid, and the zoom mechanism isn't as perfectly smooth. All that being said, it's a great lens and if it was a difference of this one for $199 and those issues fixed in  a more expensive one, I'll take this one. I didn't buy it as my main lens, it's there for telephoto reach and it does that well. It works fine, takes great pics, and didn't break the bank. If you will be working in this range the majority of the time, I'd recommend the 75-300 of Pro model because I'm sure they are better lenses, but if you're looking for a compliment to a kit lens or prime and can't spend $500+ then you can't go wrong with this one.",9/26/2014

I knew that the focal length of the lens had to be entered for the IBIS to work, but it was only on page 320+ of the advanced manual that I dissevered that, for a zoom lens, you have to enter the chosen focal length &#34;at time of recording!&#34;<br /><br />Meaning every time you change the focal length (from 40 to 100 to 150 or whatever), you have to dig through the Menu system and enter that specific FL for the body stabilization to work. You can't enter the range of the zoom and be done with it. Extremely awkward, meaning that you miss some shots while adjusting the zoom. For a fixed focal-length lens, you just enter that once and the GX7 remembers it.<br /><br />I returned this lens in exchange for a Panasonic lens with integrated stabilization.

This thing is chintzy. It is all plastic. It feels like a toy in hand. No compromises were made in the price of this lens. Every expense was spared. The build of this lens is, at best, as bad as the worst kit lens I have used in the last decade. That isn't to say it feels bad. It doesn't.  But you're not going to mistake it for a well built lens once you've actually used one. And you know what?  That's fine.<br /><br />I don't think this lens is great for the normal price.  But at the sale price? You can't not buy it, even if you have a nicer setup.  Why is that?  This thing is absolutely, positively, miniscule. It will fit in many pockets. It barely weighs more than a pancake lens. It isn't any longer when retracted than many little kit lenses, so it can fit in very shallow spaces.<br /><br />I use an Olympus PEN alongside my big Canon system, and particularly with prime lenses, it can compare very well to my 6D and 24-105L.  If I only bring the Pen with me, I never feel bad about it like I did when I used to use a P&S as a secondary lightweight camera.  The 40-150 isn't good enough to hold the mantle of &#34;Well, this is damn near as good as my big kit!&#34;.  It's not even as good as the first generation Canon 55-250mm IS... but it's close enough to that that the size and price make up for everything - it makes the Canon 55-250mm look like a monster in comparison.<br /><br />If you need some reach on an m4/3 camera, but also desire the smallest possible kit - this lens is a fantastic little compromise in a tiny, inexpensive package. It won't wow you if you're used to shooting bigger lenses, but if you want something that you can take anywhere, aren't too fussy about the results, and, if you can get close enough, will get some genuinely good looking shots.  Some people freak out a little bit when you point a &#34;small&#34; telephoto lens - my 70-200 f4L is a relatively compact telephoto lens for a full frame system, and it will literally scare some people away from the camera because they think I am filling the whole picture with a pimple. While a quick look through the lens can quell that fear, this little lens will scare nobody.<br /><br />In short, this is a fun little lens. Image quality isn't great on an absolute scale, but it's good enough for casual use, and will surprise you from time to time.  But it is so tiny and so inexpensive that there's literally nothing like it out there at all with this sort of range.  Pick this lens up. Shove it somewhere when you're bringing your camera around, and you might just find a shot with it that you would have never had otherwise.<br /><br />After all, if the best camera is the one you have with you, shouldn't that apply to lenses too?",6/1/2015

Having used this at sporting events, I can say it's pretty useful but again, do not go buying this thinking you're going to get as close to the action as you think.  If massive zoom is what you're looking for, spring for the 75-300mm lenses.<br /><br />This is a very decent lens on it's own, but I would not pay almost $200 dollars for it. For one thing, it's lightness is also a bit of a weakness--this is not a lens that would survive a drop of more than a foot, I don't think.  It takes very nice pictures even at full zoom, and having a zoom lens that can autofocus is a big time-saver.<br /><br />As part of a 2-lens kit set, it's especially good value, and is offered with several of the Olympus Cameras on the market along with the 14-42mm lens, also great for beginners.  Like one of the other reviewers have said, if you can get a deal on it, and don't care to own one of the larger zooms, this one might suit you.",12/22/2014

I purchased this panel as part of a kit and added the cellular communicator since I do not have a land line.  I also added 6 additional [[ASIN:B002MA8GKW Honeywell 5816WMWH Door / Window Transmitters]], a [[ASIN:B0017KD4FA Honeywell 5808W3 Wireless Photoelectric Smoke/Heat Detector]], a [[ASIN:B001UKH4OY Honeywell 5853 Wireless Glass Break Detector]] and an extra [[ASIN:B004W0EQIG Honeywell 5834-4 Wireless Key Remote]] and it accepted all of them.  Just FYI, this is not 100% wireless in the sense that you can just hang this on your wall and you are good to go.  You will have to run power from a socket, where you plug the transformer in, up your wall to the panel location as well as run a ground wire (its not grounded at the plug).  I tied into the existing ground wire system running through my house.  Once its powered, the rest is all wireless!  (unless, of course, you are running this to a land line)<br /><br />IMO, the two main down sides to this panel are the following:<br /><br />- A criminal can disable your system faster since this is an &#34;All in One&#34; system with the 'brains' and communicator built into the panel.  For wired systems, those things are locked away in a closet somewhere and the panel is just an interface.  If the burglar rips the panel off the wall and smashes it before it calls your alarm company (i.e. during that 30 second pause to allow a user to enter the code), the alarm is disabled..... UNLESS you get 'smash protection' monitoring from your alarm company.  With this, the alarm company is notified when the system is tripped / prompted for a code.  If they do not get a second notification that the code was entered and alarm disabled, they'll know that the system was compromised.  This additional monitoring was $2 per month for me, but was cheaper than installing a wired system to protect me from this possibility.  If this is important to you, confirm with the seller that the L3000 you are buying is version 21.10 or higher, otherwise it may not be equipped with Advanced Protection Logic (APL) in order to perform this function.  If you cant verify, then the [[ASIN:B00L9LRFGQ Honeywell L5200 Lynx Touch]] may be a better option.  I purchased mine Feb 2015 and its version 30.00, so if its not old stock, its probably okay.<br /><br />- Secondly, the alarm sound is very weak.  Its a loud constant buzz that sounds more like an older smoke alarm.  Actually my smoke alarms are louder.  You may want to consider a separate siren if you really want to scare the pants off a would be burglar.  For an addational siren, you can get a [[ASIN:B0006M1HWW Honeywell Ademco 5800WAVE Wireless Siren]], which is expensive, or if you are comfortable running some wire, it will allow you to wire up the [[ASIN:B0006BCCAE Honeywell WAVE-2 Two Tone Siren]] to the panel, which is the option I took.  I don't have this one, but the [[ASIN:B005MQUUFW Honeywell WAVE2PD]] may be an even better option since its lower power and would not drain your backup battery as fast or may allow you to install multiple sirens.<br /><br />For the money, this is still a good option and is ideal for DIY since installation is simple.  Look around for the best price since they fluctuate often.  I ended up buying the kit (with cellular module, google Item # L3000PK_GSMVLP-4G) and getting monitoring through Geoarm.

This one is at least $145 cheaper, the same weight (if not less), and a literal tank -- total overkill for my 300 f/4 and 1.4x teleconverter.<br /><br />Relative to the European competition, this model is extremely stiff.  It's not even close.  The narrowest section of this monopod is almost twice as wide as the narrowest section of the European one, and the joints are solid -- no hinging or flex, again, unlike the euro-pod.<br /><br />The twist locks are about as smooth as the European counterpart, if not smoother, and easier to grip. The locking platform right below the head is extremely solid.<br /><br />The only downsides I can see are:<br /><br />Collapsed Size -- that this monopod is about 2 inches longer than the 3551 when fully collapsed<br />Foam Grip -- could be glued a bit better -- really not much of an issue<br />Spike-foot -- I wonder if after a lot of use, the rubber foot could wear down far enough that the retractable spike (very cool BTW) could end up slightly protruding even when retracted, potentially scratching floors if used indoors<br /><br />For my applications, the 324 may have been a better choice, but I'm paying practically no weight or cost penalty for the 424 model.

The only problem is we (husband & I) have tried everything we can think of to get rid of a very powerful/offensive odor that is either coming from the vinyl on the pad, the pad itself or the lube that is quite thick on the cylinder. While practicing lighting etc.with my grandson, thinking I had gotten rid of the odor once and for all ended up not being the case! All the sudden my grandson who was leaning against and on it pulled his elbows away and rubbed his eyes and said that something was burning his eyes, they were literally watering!!! I immediately I pulled it out of the studio and once again back into the garage. I can't use it with this being an issue. I am so frustrated to begin with, because the first one I received was broke and of course Amazon took care of things immediately to assure my satisfaction. But unfortunately I cannot use it either because this is a big problem. I sure wish I knew how to get rid of the overwhelming smell because I would really love to use it as a great addition to the posing factor! I guess I will have to give up on it unless someone can advise me on how to take care of the problem.

My six-year-old 8.1MP beats it hands down.  I received this shortly before my niece's wedding and played with it enough beforehand to figure out the basic points of operation.  It did not come with any instructions to note, just a sheet that told where to put the batteries (AAA, not lithium), the wrist strap, and the enclosed 4GB memory card.  The camera seems very flimsy, especially the door to the battery compartment, so be very careful when operating it.  The memory card just plugs into the slot with a firm push of a fingernail, with no door to keep out the dust.  The lens is recessed - again, no cover.  Out of 21 pictures that I took, only six were salvageable.  I deliberately did not set the date, because I didn't want it to appear on the pictures.  The camera included it anyway on all shots (with some random date!). Also, even though I set the flash feature, it is apparently not the default setting, because most of my pictures came out too dark.  You would think if it had any flash default at all, it would be \\""on\\"" or \\""auto.\\"" Nope, not a chance. You can adjust the resolution, and I set it to 12MP, but my 8MP camera takes more detailed photos.  Additionally, the touch screen is not very user-friendly, either, so you may have to touch the menu you want several times, and then try scrolling repeatedly.  While I was initially setting the language, it didn't want to scroll to \\""English,\\"" and it took me nearly ten minutes to get out of Spanish mode. I suppose it's better than asking a toddler to sketch your cherished events with a crayon, but that's the nicest thing I've found to say about this product. I may just toss it in the garbage, because it is of no further use to me whatsoever.",8/4/2013

I especially appreciate its simplicity of design. For example, the battery charger is just a plastic box, two inches by two inches and an inch deep, with a space to insert the battery on one side and flip-out prongs to go in an electrical outlet on the other. No cords, no heavy transformer brick; simple! Or consider the compartment for the battery. The spring-loaded lid has a completely mechanical latch that you push one way when opening the compartment and push the other way when closing it. The latch that holds the battery in place in the compartment functions similarly. No unnecessary button or electronic complexity between your hand and this necessary bit of housekeeping - accessing the battery - and thus that much less chance of unnecessary malfunction.<br /><br />I have been completely satisfied with the still pictures this camera has produced. It also has functioned very well as a low-resolution video camera - including sound, though of a mediocre quality. You can review video, as well as stills, right on the camera. The optical zoom can be very useful, producing decent photos even when the camera is hand-held, and very good close-ups when using a tripod.<br /><br />If there were anything I disliked about this camera, I would mention it, but there just isn't.",11/9/2013

THERE WAS A LICENCE PLATE NUMBER ON A TRUCK, BY THE WAY THEY EXPIRED 7/2010, WHICH LEFT ME NO CLUES.

I think this is an awesome lens!<br /><br />GENERAL OVERALL IMPRESSION<br /><br />I just received my new Olympus OMD EM-1 (replacing my OMD EM-5) and I was anxious to try some Olympus Four Thirds glass on the camera. (I also had purchased the MMF-3 4/3 Adapter). After a few days of significant research, I settled on this little gem.<br /><br />OTHER THOUGHTS<br /><br />I spent most of yesterday using this lens with my EM-1 and I am very happy with the results. Since I also own the Panasonic Lumix G X Vario 12-35mm f/2.8, I was especially interested in comparing the two lenses. I likely will only keep one.<br /><br />To be sure, the Oly is quite a bit larger and heavier than the Panny lens. The difference, however, is not so great that it created any real additional burden as a walk-around lens. Still, if you are looking for the smallest camera/ lens combo, then the Panny would probably be your choice.<br /><br />Build-quality goes to the Oly. It feels much more solid than the Panasonic and the zoom and focus rings operate smoothly. Both are weather-sealed, but, in my opinion, the Olympus really feels like it has a much better build. (Both have metal rings , but there seems to be much more plastic in the Panny lens construction.)<br /><br />Not that I wanted this review to be a comparison between these two lenses, but the purchase of this lens, for me, was as a possible replacement for the Panasonic. Admittedly, I've never been able to bond with the Panny lens, but up until now, it was really the only option I had for a fast standard zoom on a Micro Four Thirds camera.<br /><br />The 14-54mm (effective 28mm-108mm) is perfect for me as a walk-around lens and the f2.8-3.5 is certainly fast enough for low light conditions. Quality is excellent and the price of the Oly is significantly less than the Panasonic.<br /><br />I was especially interested in the Auto Focus speed of this lens. The ability to use both M4/3 lenses and Four Thirds was one of the many reasons I purchased the EM-1. With both Phase and Contrast Detection, I was curious to compare AF speeds. Was I disappointed with the Olympus? Not at all. In fact, I was quite impress. While it may not be quite as fast as a M4/3 lens on my camera, it is pretty darn quick.<br /><br />FINAL THOUGHTS<br /><br />I'm not a professional photographer. I'm just a guy who likes to take a lot of pictures (I have over 60,000 photos in my database) Landscapes, vacations, street shooting, grandkids.....you name it. Given that I'm just an average photo nut that does a lot of different kinds of everyday-type photography, I'm at a bit of a loss to explain all the technical reasons why I like the lens. All I can say is that I bonded with it immediately and the results have been really really good.<br /><br />In the end, all I can say is that I simply really like the build, picture quality, and the way the lens feels and operates on my camera. Is it perfect?  Of course not. For one things the Panasonic definitely has a size and weight advantage over the Olympus. There are always trade-offs to be sure, but overall, the one thing I can say which probably sums up my feelings on this lens is this:<br /><br />I put my Panasonic 12-35 up for sale yesterday. I'm keeping the Olympus 14-54.",10/23/2013

However, this lens is also sharper, and is capable of noticeably better (more nuanced) color rendition, than the 12-50mm. The \\""bokeh\\"" this lens produces is also creamier than that of the 12-50mm (which is not capable of much bokeh).<br /><br />These difference are apparent especially in portraits and pictures of buildings, where the \\""pro\\"" quality look is definitely there. The confidence this lens inspires with its superb image quality makes it enough for me to recommend this lens highly, despite the difference in price. (As an example of the improved image quality, this lens is capable of rendering the \\""glassy look\\"" in portrait photography when focusing on a subject's eye).<br /><br />Having said that, for low light situations, I still prefer to use my Panasonic-Leica 25mm/1.4 lens. So, on my summer vacation, I carried both the 14-54mm II and the PL 25mm lenses which worked great for all the situations I needed.<br /><br />The other great thing about is this lens, when coupled with the [[ASIN:B0074WDG1C Olympus MMF-3  4/3  to Micro 4/3 Adapter]] on the OM-D, is that it is weather sealed (like the 12-50mm). The build quality of this lens is top notch, and it has the \\""made in Japan\\"" seal on it.<br /><br />On the downside, the auto-focus is slower (typically 0.5 - 1 second), audible (though not noisy) and it can hunt in some cases. This is not a major bother for me, since it is still able to nail focus, with face detection on, most of the time. However, the focus hunting can be an issue with video.<br /><br />The lens is pretty heavy, and necessitates the use of a hand grip on the OM-D. Instead of the HLD-6 battery grip, I use a third-party metal grip found on eBay, which is also similar to some of the third party grips sold on Amazon.<br /><br />Technical reviews indicate that chromatic aberration (CA) is present on this lens, and I am beginning to notice it when I look at high contrast, wide angle pictures. I can see slight cyan/magenta CA near the edges of the frame. This can be easily corrected with appropriate software (I used Corel Aftershot Pro). Also note that Panasonic Lumix micro four-thirds cameras have built in CA correction.<br /><br />Having said all this, I am not selling my M.Zuiko 12-50mm just yet, since it is still a great performer in most conditions except low light, and is better than the 14-54mm II for video. So when convenience is desired, I take my 12-50mm. But when high image quality and zoom capability is desired, it's the 14-54mm II that needs to stay on my OM-D.<br /><br />I have not tried the macro capabilities. But from what I have read, this lens is at least as good as the 12-50mm for macro.<br /><br />If you go on vacation, this may be the only lens you need on the Olympus OMD, especially if you use the 2X digital teleconterter on the OMD. It is capable of producing outstanding full size images (4608x3456) that you have to \\""pixel peep\\"" to notice the difference. I set my Fn2 button on my OMD to the teleconverter mode. This effectively brings this lens to a 28mm - 216mm lens (in 35mm equivalent) at the touch of a button. Purists may frown on using digital teleconversion, but the results are so marvelous that I have no qualms about using this mode.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say, if you can afford it, definitely consider the Olympus 14-54mm II as high-quality \\""go anywhere\\"" lens. The extra size and weight over the 12-50mm kit lens is the compromise you need to make in order to obtain noticeably better image quality.",8/22/2013

I'll give my pros and the cons below.<br />Pros:<br />- Extremely high zoom, highest zoom compact camera ever.<br />- Full PASM shooting modes.<br />- Very smooth video, 1080p.<br />- Excellent photo quality with adequate lightning.<br />- Amazing design, high quality.<br />- Attractive! :D<br />- High resolution LCD screen.<br />- Nice grip to hold on to.<br />- NI Shoe for attaching accesories.<br />- Dedicated EV control dial, quick access.<br />- HDMI, long battery life, quality flash, very fast shooting.<br />- WIFI transfer and control!<br />- and a slew of other creative features, including GPS.<br />Cons:<br />- Doesnt shoot in RAW (not a problem for me but could be for more advanced users)<br />- LCD a little dim in direct sunlight.<br />- Flash isn't tiltable. (minor inconvenience but not terrible.)<br />- Image quality suffers in night time shooting. (problem with most cameras)<br /><br />So as a final conclusion this camera is AMAZING, just not in pitch black lighting, and its lacking some features that pros would need, but if your a pro you probably aren't using a point and shoot now are you?<br />So go buy it if your looking for the smallest camera with the biggest zoom available.",12/31/2013

I don't like large cameras because I take pictures all the time, and prefer something that is small enough to fit in my purse or just carry around without it being a huge hassle. This camera lends to that VERY well, and the pictures are fantastic! We happened to purchase right around a pretty decent sale, so we feel like we got a lot of camera for a very decent cost. I've seen a few complaints about the ease of use, but I haven't had any issues. I have previously owned small Canon cameras and didn't have any issue adjusting to this Sony.<br /><br />The picture quality of this camera is wonderful for the size of the camera. Sure, a more advanced camera might capture better pictures yet, but my personal preference was for a smaller size over a higher quality picture. We originally purchased this camera for our European tour and I couldn't have picked a better camera for that trip. Our photo quality was awesome, and many of our pictures look like postcards. The zooming on this camera is amazing and the fact that the pictures don't get blurry when you zoom is pretty amazing. As with most cameras, the night pictures don't always turn out well, but the Intelligent and Superior Intelligent (I think those are the names) settings on the camera did a pretty good job to capture some decent night pictures. And the best part yet, this camera was small enough for me to carry everywhere and not feel burdened by it.<br /><br />We have since used this camera for many other purposes and I absolutely cannot complain. It has a lot of neat features like Color Pop, picking out the red colors in the picture and turning everything else gray, etc. I have really enjoyed those features, as I don't take time to edit pictures on my computer or anything, so the fact that the camera has these features is really nice and adds some fun/creativity to my pictures.<br /><br />All in all, I would highly recommend this camera. It's small and fairly light, so it's easy to carry around, but it has some amazing zooming power and photo quality that makes most of the images look as if they were taken by the huge, advanced SLR cameras. I have absolutely no regrets! This is by far the best camera I have ever owned.",7/10/2014

You can carry the camera in your pocket and take it out for a quick and unexpected picture in a few seconds.<br />Full manual or full automatic shooting settings available. And all in between. And sure, GPS and wifi. Wifi shooting ,though, is not as usable as I expected. Too much delay between the camera and the phone.<br />GPS turned to be a surprisingly useful feature.

Does well on aperture priority, or when left to it's own devices. It takes fantastic low-light/odd light shots with no flash or tripod, like in museums and such.  My only complaint is that it's rather slow from shot to shot, unless you're using the continuous shooting feature.  But it takes many, many, MANY, frustrating attempts to get a few decent shots of cats indoors.  (I'm the cat tech of a humane society, it's my job to take photos of the cats.  So I'm not just any regular cat lady, I'm a Professional Cat Lady!)  Otherwise, for toting around when you want a more than decent camera without lugging around 9 pounds of gear, it's really quite perfect.

When shooting in manual you have to hit the center button on the control wheel every time you want to change shutter speed or aperture. Go back to focus with a half press of the shutter, and then you have to hit the center button again to change either. Okay, so you don't necessarily buy a camera like this to shoot manual.  But I am used to shooting manual with my SLRs, and it is nice for Sony to include it on this camera, but its implementation is so poor that it is pretty useless.  The menu is pretty laborious in use as well as everything is arranged in a continuous scroll.  Furthermore, everything you can tune, such as sharpness and noise, has no fine control.  Each setting has just three settings.<br /><br />Well, one would hope that if you can learn to live with all of the operational issues, the image quality would make up for it.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  Image quality is poor.  Even at base ISO all pictures have that watercolor effect where everything is smeared.  Every image from this camera simply lacks any fine detail.  You do not have to pixel peep to see this.  Even at 8x10 the smearing is evident.  I took a photo of a brick house and all the mortar between the bricks was either washed out or wavy even without zooming in.  I am aware this is common among cameras with such high resolution on tiny pinky nail sized sensors.  I'm sorry, but 20 megapixels is just way too much for a sensor this small.  In my experience 12 megapixels is the sweet spot for compact cameras.<br /><br />To make things even worse, the camera I received had a lens centering defect.  The left side of all pictures I took were blurred while the right side was sharp(er).  This was very evident at 24mm-35mm and less evident from 35mm on.  This is just something to be aware of and look for if you happen to buy this camera.<br /><br />Then there is the screen.  I have never had so much trouble seeing a camera screen outdoors.  Even with the brightness turned all the way up it is nearly impossible to make out any detail on the screen in daylight.  The screen is high resolution but appears to be very low quality.  It is extremely reflective and the lighting is also uneven.  Comparing this screen to the one on my Canon S100 outdoors is a totally different experience.  While both are harder to view outdoors, the HX50V screen is far more difficult to use.  All I could do was look for highlights in the image, such as a white car here or a bright sign there, to line up my shot.<br /><br />Finally, the camera is metal on the front but the rest is plastic.  I don't mind plastic when it is of high quality, but the plastics used here appear very thin and cheap.  I am not sure how long the battery door on the camera would last as it feel very flimsy.  The camera feels lighter than it should and the quality feels lower than it should for a premium compact camera.<br /><br />Ultimately, the lens defect on the unit I received was unacceptable and I returned it. I probably would have returned it even if it was not defective mainly because the screen is so hard to see and the images lack detail.  I would not recommend this camera.",5/10/2014

It has lots of options that make it useful; however, to me, the camera feels a bit cheaply made, more like a plastic toy camera...which is a shame. I was hoping it would have the build quality of my canon G15. I feel like I have to be careful pressing the buttons on the back in fear that I'll break something, oh, and the screen is very difficult, if not impossible to see in bright light. Also, the camera seems very slow, no matter how fast a card I put in it. With those issues aside, the camera seems to make decent photos and has a great zoom.<br /><br />I'm somewhat disappointed with the camera due to the build quality issue and the overall slowness of the camera, but hoping that the other good things outweigh it in the end. If I had paid full retail for the camera, I would have returned it and kept looking.<br /><br />UPDATE: 5/27/14<br /><br />I've been using the camera for about a week. So far, I can say that the slow write speeds are getting frustrating. I'm using a UH1 class 10 32GB card with a 90MB/S write speed and it's still slow. After a burst shot, you have to wait a few seconds (5-10) before you can shoot again. I don't know why they aren't releasing the HX60 here in the US when it's out in many countries elsewhere.

I was amazed at the 30x optical zoom and stabilization on my pictures.  This camera really gets a clear 30x zoom pic. Panorama great, low light great, options on camera are so vast it will take years to figure it all out. MP4 movie options for Mac users(a big issue for me on other cameras).

The shots look good on the screen, but haven't printed any out.  The screen is sharp and clear, but I usually have to totally switch to the Canon SX 50 HS when I shoot in bright light.  The screen just seems to disappear in bright sun. The Canon is bigger of course.<br />The Sony is an ideal camera to carry all the time, because of the size. Unfortunately, both the Canon and Sony adjustment wheels do not have enough relief to work well with my fingers when I have to change a setting.

Lens will not retract on power off, cannot take photo or video. Sony customer support was terrible, accused me of mistreating the camera. Was excellent while it lasted, but get the extended warranty or accept the risk.  I was looking for a replacement for my old Nikon S8100 with more resolution and zoom range, to complement my Micro 4/3 and Nikon DSLR in travel situations.  I compared the HX50V, Nikon S9700 and Panasonic ZS40.  The Good: - Highest resolution. In good light (which is all these cameras can handle anyway), the additional detail is well resolved. - 24-720mm, not 25-750mm equivalent. That extra 1mm at the wide end makes more difference than an extra 30mm at the Tele end. - Intelligent sweep panorama. In-camera panorama creation that works well in wide open spaces / landscapes. - Hot shoe for light panel or flash mount. - Good ergonomics & controls, including an exposure compensation dial and custom function button - 1080p 60fps video with smooth, variable zoom speed - Cheapest of the three (purchased at $247)  The Bad: - UPDATE: Dead after 15 months. - Bulkiest 30x compact travel zoom. At 38mm thick, this is considerably fatter than either the Nikon or the Panasonic. - Visible monochromatic noise, even at ISO100. Becomes problematic over ISO400 - No external charger supplied   The Ugly: - Nothing, really. This is a small-sensor, high-resolution camera that will struggle to focus and will produce noise in low light. Use it as intended (daylight, low ISO) and it works perfectly.",5/12/2014

The zoom range is amazing, and the bright light image quality is good. The lens also starts at a wide 24mm (35 equiv) -- which I like.  The exposure compensation dial is very handy as well. But the lower light (even just shade--I'm not talking indoors here) performance is disappointing. I understand they had to make compromises for the long lens, but I didn't think they would be this big.  Also, the menu system is slow and clunky, and you can't set the screen to stay on for more than about 5 seconds after you shoot a picture. That's lame. Next time a Panasonic (I like the 24mm wide lens, and it is hard to find).  UPDATE: This camera has been a huge disappointment. Used it alongside a better camera on once-in-a-lifetime trip to Thailand. Went to see monkeys, needed a long zoom that the better camera didn't have.

The sensor provides decent image quality, and while it's not a D-SLR is sure goes more places. While manual, aperture and shutter priority modes are appreciated, it would've been nice to have the option to shoot in RAW. The 1080p video quality is acceptable, but you're not shooting an indie film with this camera. Video-mode is easily accessible with one button.<br /><br />The pop-up flash is out of the way enough that redeye is very rare. Image quality in normal lighting is excellent up to ISO 1600. Low light shooting is quite acceptable, but grain starts becoming more and more apparent with higher ISOs. Still for a P&S the low light image quality is quite good.

Then do the reverse before putting it back in the case. When up, you have no place to hold the camera steady.<br /><br />That said, the 50v is a small dream camera.

We have married up this camera with a carbon fiber monipod to help steady and compose pictures.  Works very well. Has stabilization so shoots well even without the monopod.<br /><br />The overall size of this camera fits even a man's hand and feels secure.  Well made.<br /><br />Now we both have the same camera, monipod and are ready for a trip;.  Let the competition begin!<br /><br />Would recommend.",7/12/2015

That being said, I have purchased many camera's over the years.  A few years ago I purchased this camera except with the 18MP and 20X zoom and have carried that sucker everywhere.  At first, it was along with my larger &#34;better and more expensive&#34; camera. Then I realized I took more pictures with it because it was easier to pull out and use and the pictures come out perfectly.<br /><br />I decided it was time for an upgrade and bought this one a week ago. Since I am familiar with most of the settings, it is like home.  It has some better features than the previous and I also bought the additional flash to attach.  I love being able to stick this in a very small purse and drag it around everywhere.  I took it to the rodeo and got great shots of the performer and the riders.  Even though far away, they looked like I was sitting in first row.  The pictures of my kids and great nephews are wonderful...  I love the 10 picture setting where I can click 10 pictures withing seconds. Quick shutter speed. I will have to add some pictures once I am home again.  So far, I am pleased with this model as I was the previous.<br /><br />My favorite feature, as with the previous model, is the video function.  At ANY time you can click the video button and start recording.  WHILE you are recording you can take snap shots.  I use this as much for a camcorder as a camera and never miss a funny or special moment.  Video is in HD and comes out really clean.<br /><br />Like I said, I am a normal person, not a photographer.  Even though I have taken hundreds of pictures, they are for fun and family.  If you choose to carry a smaller camera that takes great pictures, this one is a good choice.  Especially if you spend alot of time at sporting events for kids and want those close up pictures.  Buy it.",3/11/2014

I purchased this DSC-HX50V because I was...and am...a big fan of the camera series and the many things they do really well.  It has more features and a longer digital zoom than previous models.... and most other compact camera models in its class.  However,  the  reach has exceeded what seems to be the same quality limit as the HX20V.  The further you reach the bigger the drop off in quality to the point the recorded image becomes a nearly unrecognizable  blur.<br /><br />This is a really good camera in  a small package however...and at the moment surprisingly cheaper than the HX20V.  Maybe that's because it is made in China instead of Japan.<br /><br />One thing I'm not crazy about is that you have to push a button to get the flash to pop up.  The extended height of the flash has some benefits but it looks a bit frail and the auto flash, when you want it, in the HX20V suited me better.<br /><br />However, you could do worse than buying this camera.

I still am looking how to increase (or decrease) the time period between the selection of an item like Aperture or Speed from the top dial and moving the wheel left or right to increase or decrease: the time is too short between the selection of a process and modifying its function and so one has to start again until one is quicker or learns how to modify time periods...I will be looking for the window for changing time periods for length of viewing photos, etc. I can't believe it would take much to put threads on the lens so that filters could be used. If this is the smallest P&S it couldn't be by much even in comparison with my SAMSUNG.

The flash is now broken and none of the troubleshooting fixed the problem.  This is a known problem for over 10 years.  Sony is refusing to fix it.  Here is the message I posted on their facebook page.  Please don't buy this.  It may work ok for a little while,  but less than a year is not a good product.<br />&#34;This is a warning for current or future customers of Sony cameras. I was given a Sony Cybershot DSC-Hx50V as a Christmas gift last year from my Dad. It was purchased on Nov 17 but was not taken out of the box or used until Christmas when we received. At the beginning of Dec we noticed the flash would not work. After trying every suggestion it was still not working. When I contacted Sony, they refused to repair the problem. This is a $300+ camera that should last at least 3-5 years. This didn't make it 1 year. Despite being in contact with management no one at this company is willing to stand by their product. As a side note, my problem is one that has been documented for over 10 years with this camera. So Sony is well aware of this problem, and continues to tell me that I have to repair it at my cost. We never had this problem with our previous Cannon, which we gave to my sister and is till going strong some 6 years later. Future consumers please be aware. My in-laws had a similar problem with the Sony camera, which was less than 1 year old and Sony refused to repair it. Such a shame.

I am terrible at photography, so I expected my pictures to be mediocre, but this camera did all the work, and the pictures were so good I got accused of stealing professional photos. If I were a more patient person I probably would've been able to use some of the more advanced features for even better results, but I basically opened the box, charged it up, added a memory card and started taking pictures without bothering to learn anything and still ended up with videos and pictures that other fans loved because they were so good.<br /><br />-It lets you take stills while recording video without interruption, so basically I just let it record and kept hitting the button to grab pictures.<br />-The zoom is outstanding, a little less clear with the digital than the optical, but the optical is so close I didn't have to use the digital hardly at all.<br />-The motion stabilization features meant that I didn't have very many blurry pictures, and this was in rapidly changing natural lighting at an outdoor venue, with a lot of intense stage lights as well, and fast moving performers.<br />-The video is good enough that I was able to pull great stills after the fact by importing frames into Photoshop--not as great as the photos taken in picture mode, but pretty good.<br />-The audio is good considering the type of show we were at (pop music, lots of bass and blaring and screaming fans) and we were able to hear individual voices and instruments clearly in the videos without much distortion.<br />-It's pretty teeny and compact so it didn't take up much space in the small bag I had and I didn't have to set it down between videos, and it was always ready to go.<br /><br />Definitely get a memory card, so you don't have to decrease the definition and resolution (or worse, delete your stuff) for reasons of space. I had about 4 hours of high definition footage and hundreds of high resolution photos and used up about 20 GB of space, so a 32 GB card did well for me (Transcend 32 GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card (TS32GSDHC10E)).<br /><br />I also had a case (Case Logic DCB-302 Compact Case for Camera - Black), and it doesn't seem like the camera will fit in it, but it does. Get a bigger one if you want to take anything but the camera and cord and maybe a memory card or two.<br /><br />I also had a battery pack that I use for my iPhone but it charged this camera as well which was highly convenient (Anker┬« Astro 5600mAh Portable External Battery Charger). I'm sure there are chargers or battery packs that charge faster but it did the job.<br /><br />Obviously I'm not a photographer or a technical person, so I feel confident that anyone can use this camera to take great pictures if I can do it.",9/3/2014

I have a DSLR, but for my travel that is too much stuff to carry around. I wanted a camera that was light and could be used at a moments notice. I bough this camera and went to test it out. There are a lot of features that I will probably never use, but it is packed with them. I love the size and portability of this camera. It takes really good pictures indoors because of the CMOS sensor. Noise levels are at 3200 and 6400 ISO or higher. There are a lot of features that rival DSLR cameras, including manual settings, and all in a pocket sized camera. I am still learning the camera and more info coming soon. If you want to use this camera right, read the manual. This camera needs to be studied to get proper use of it. Menus are easy to get to, but the features are sometimes buried where you have to take a few steps to get to them. If you want to take long zoom pictures, the camera is pretty front heavy and the picture in the viewfinder tends to move a lot while focusing. It is best to use a tripod when you wish to take really long zoom pics.<br /><br />This camera fits the bill for ease of use with my travel pics. I have to sometimes climb rocks and things as that. I like the fact I can carry a tripod that is not heavy and get use out of this camera with that. I will use this camera to its full capability as I learn more of it. I would also say that it is tough seeing the viewfinder in really bright sunlight unless you can find someway to shield it.<br /><br />I will say learn this camera and it will fit your needs for a travel sized camera with a long zoom. i have seen people say that they would return it. I think this camera is built for a certain niche of people, those that like a small camera that is packed with DSLR type features. i am not returning mine, rather just learn it better.

It was everything promised yet was returned after a weekend. The problem? It's a low-light portrait/video performer only capable of 7x zoom, and the more you zoom, the slower it gets. The best camera is the one you've got with you, and the HX50 puts awesome travel firepower in your coat. Not only does it excel at &#34;reaching out&#34; to grab the name of that freighter 3 miles off in the sunset, the image stabilization is so good you'll get clear shots despite taking them from the rolling deck of your own ship. And then, when you dip into Clear Image to try it at 60x, it still delivers sharpness.<br /><br />That's not merely good. It's a superb feat of engineering to shoe-horn that level of ability into a body this small. None of the popular little Canon point-and-zooms can touch this, not without pulling a tripod out of their ***. And while I'd love to have the Lumix FZ-200 with its constant f2.8 Leica lens and sport zoomability, I'd need to hire a footman from Downton Abbey to carry it for me. My wife would flatly refuse and my children, while enthusiastic, are tragically unreliable with Leicas.<br /><br />So there we are. If you're looking for high-IQ innards, dirt simple user interfaces or to do a professional wedding shoot, this isn't the right brush. (Thus the 4 stars.) For a spiffy handler with auto modes you don't have to worry about, video quality that eliminates the need for a travel camcorder along with surprisingly decent low-light chops, then we are talking! Again, it truly shines when you've spotted a Big Game shot and you've got about 5 seconds to reach into your pocket, turn it on, zoom it down and bag it with beautiful clarity. At that challenging task it's a joy, it's a breakthrough, and it's also a steal.",2/12/2014

My main cameras are a Canon 60d slr and a Sony NEX 5n.  I use the slr when image quality is of utmost priority, but I don't like to lug it and several lenses around all the time.  I use the Sony NEX 5n for most of my everyday shooting, but my longest zoom lens for that only goes to 200m.  I wanted a camera that was purse or jacket pocket sized with a long zoom for taking on walks and for that unexpected photo opportunity.<br /><br />I knew that a 20 MP camera with a tiny sensor and huge zoom simply could not produce photos with image quality to compare to my other cameras, so I went into it with realistic expectations. After several hundred photos, I would say the HX50V meets or exceeds my expectations for image quality.<br /><br />I have a few frustrations with this camera, but some of them I knew about going into it.  For instance, having to charge the battery in-camera puts the camera out of commission while it's recharging.  This necessitated the purchase of an external battery charger.<br /><br />Some of the settings are buried in the menu and cumbersome to get to, such as the \\""format\\"" setting to reformat the memory card.  It's a struggle to get to \\""format\\"",  and I like to reformat the card every time I download a batch of photos.<br /><br />Image stabilization works well on the camera.  The colors are very accurate, particularly when you have the color setting set to to R to achieve more natural looking photos.  The auto white balance seems to do a good job.<br /><br />It seems to me that there is a bit of a lag when hitting the review button....like the camera takes a bit longer than I'm accustomed to to write to the card.  I'm using a 10x speed card.<br /><br />When researching travel zooms, I narrowed it down to the Canon SX280 HS and the Sony HX50v.  I chose the Sony mainly for the 30x zoom over Canon's 20x, and extra megapixels to allow for more cropping.  The battery life on the Sony is rated at 400 shots compared to Canon's 260 shots, also.<br /><br />This is not a camera for someone who requires Dslr quality photos.  Images, when viewed at full size, frequently resemble water color paintings.  They look fine when viewed at a size to fit most monitors.  I haven't printed any of my photos yet, but I'm guessing that if I tried to print an image at anything above 8x10 it would likely present that water color painting effect.<br /><br />I would not want this to be my only camera, but as a sidekick to my other cameras I think it's going to meet my needs.",12/1/2013

I had splurged on a really expensive Nikon last year, but the auto focus issue made us send it back. We decided to go smaller for traveling, and the NEX camera lender are either hard to find or, in the case of the awesome all in one lens, Godzilla sized. This camera has just the right among of features, and the color is more accurate than that of our larger Sony . . . maybe the most accurate I have seen. The pictures are sharp enough, and the shots are wider than with our other set-up.

But Sony really goofed with the noise processing. I did read some reviews elsewhere that said the camera was unsuitable for any kind of serious photography but I was fooled by the Amazon ratings and comments into thinking that maybe the camera the testers used was faulty.<br />Maybe some are OK, but the one I got is a total waste of time and money.<br />I would not recommend this camera under any circumstances.",12/9/2013

There's a lot to learn but I was able to quickly get the camera to upload pictures wirelessly to my iPad. It even detects \\""infant\\"" faces. I bought the fitted case and I love the retro look. Using a 64GB memory card keeps the camera working fast. Battery holds the charge a long time.<br /><br />The camera is a bit bigger and heavier than my previous Fuji Finepix, but if size were that important I would have stuck with my phone. For serious amateurs wanting to chronicle the family this camera has it all. It will take awhile to learn all the features but I was able to hit the ground running with a couple simple settings and movies.<br /><br />The flash doesn't pop up on its on own, but I haven't used it much so I'm not sure if that's a big minus. I love that it has a hotshoe-I used an SLR back in the day and loved the bounced flash effect. Can't imagine being able to do that with this little camera. It has a 3D picture setting, won't be using that any time soon. It's tripod ready with an easy to use screw on the bottom.<br /><br />Bottom line, it's a great camera for the family photos and travel. Great quality, zoom, wireless features that allows you to share instantly. Problem: the price.  At current pricing the dilemma one has is should you go to the SLR type cameras with adjustable lenses etc.  Your call.

I'm not ready to move up to a DSLR, and I don't do any post-processing other than cropping and red-eye removal. Sometimes I take photos that look like they could have been taken by a professional photographer. I am the 'photographer' of the family, and occasionally I am the photographer for events where we sell group photos. I am familiar with the effects that ISO, shutter speed, and aperture have on photos and I do know how to use them to get the results I want, but I am not a professional photographer.<br /><br />I've had this camera for a little over a month now and have taken a little over 1000 photos with it so far. I am still learning how to use the camera, but have had amazing results with it so far even though most of the photos have only been taken in Superior Auto mode. My previous digital cameras were primarily Canons, and I wanted to stick with Canon because I'm already familiar with their menu layouts, various button placements, etc. My last 'good' camera was the Canon S5, and I almost never used it in Auto mode. The S5 was just too big and I began to find that I almost never wanted to carry it with me anymore so I needed a new camera.<br /><br />I chose this camera because I am planning a trip to Costa Rica and wanted a camera with super zoom capabilities, but in a more compact size. I wanted a camera that I could carry with me everywhere. I needed something that would fit in my medium-sized purse. I wanted a camera that had good reviews, was released within the last year, and that was made by a company that I trusted. After hours of research, it seemed that the Sony HX50V was the best fit.<br /><br />This camera does so many things! I love that I can control it with the PlayMemories app on my Samsung Note 2. I can be in the group photo and use the 2 or 10 second timer timer to take photos. I've taken landscape photos in the mountains that come out beautifully. I've gotten excellent results in handheld night shots that came out quite clear. I was able to take a handheld photo of the moon zoomed in to about 45x and the photo came out clear with great definition of the craters on the moon. The image stabilization seems to work great, because my hands really are just not that steady. I set this camera up on a tripod and used my smartphone as a remote to take photos of kids with Santa at a small event just a few days after receiving the camera. The photos were then printed out and sold to the parents and they were quite happy with them. I've played around with some of the other 'gimicky' tricks this camera will do too such as make a photo look like an illustration or watercolor painting. Those were actually fun.<br /><br />I still have to learn how to use the manual modes on this camera before my big trip. My initial shots in manual have mostly been good, but I still need more practice before I am completely comfortable with the menus and the use of all the functions. I am working my way through the manual. The camera came with a small starter manual in the box (about 40 pages), and the complete 287 page manual is available in pdf form. I would highly recommend this camera for a beginner or amatuer photographer.",1/7/2014

The buttons are where you expect them to be, and work like you'd think.<br />After owning mostly Canon products, it took me a couple of hours of going through all the menus, and options before I was comfortable finding everything.<br />I like the Smart Auto and Superior Auto settings because I can hand the camera to an electronically-challenged person and it pretty much does all the thinking for them.  The Scene mode allows a little greater control for specific situations (Portraits, Night shots, etc), but is still simple enough to understand that a person could pick it up pretty quickly.<br />At this price point, this is one of the nicer super-zooms you can buy...<br />For anyone who is kind of kicking the tires on digital cameras, I would say that you are very safe buying this camera.<br />TONS of zoom, small-frame (not ULTRA compact, but still pretty small... I where 2X shirts, and this fit in my front shirt pocket fine), lots of features, excellent picture quality... its a very versatile point-and-shoot.<br />The only 'cons' I have with this camera are:<br />1.  you have to pop up the flash if you need it... the camera can't do this automatically.  This isn't a HUGE problem because the camera takes pretty good pictures if you forget.  I just pop the flash when I start the camera, and if the camera doesn't need it, it won't use it.<br />2.  I find the auto-focus to be a little slow.<br /><br />At this price, you aren't going to find the &#34;perfect&#34; camera... you will always sacrifice something.

The last camera I bought was about 5 yrs ago, so there were a lot of technological advances I wanted to have in a newer camera that motivated my buying decision.  I have had it for about 4 weeks and am very happy with it.<br /><br />The most impressive features of this camera are:<br />1. The low light photos are outstanding and true to life..I have never needed to use the flash and photos look great.<br />2. The crazy fantastic 30x optical zoom. Excellent for sporting events.<br />3. Very viable HD camcorder substitute.  I haven't used my dedicated HD camcorder since owning the new photo camera because the quality is comparable.  I only now take one device, (camera only) to events where I used to bring two.<br />4. Transferring photos via wifi using the sony Play memories app to smart phones and tablets is a 21st century feature that lets you easily share photos with friends and family...  Once you get it going it transfers photos very fast...<br />5. Also, with the app you can control the camera remotely.  Nice feature..<br />6. The 180 and 360 degree panoramic photos you can take is also a cool feature.<br />7. Photo size, (mb), is not too large..on the highest quality setting photo size is around 3MB<br />8. GPS tracking of photos, tells you where you were when the photos were taken..cool feature when viewing on a tablet, or uploading to a social media site.<br />9. GPS tracking feature that let's you track you steps....(this is a non camera feature but still cool.)<br />10. Burst photo taking, up to 10 photos in 1 sec! Let's you capture hight speed sports action.<br />11. Loads of photo options most of which as a casual photo taker, (I don't own a SLR), I may never use, but nice to know those features are available to me if I want to use some day.<br /><br />Things that perhaps I was a little disappointed with:<br />1. (Biggest gripe) The time in between photos is not quite as fast as I would have liked when shooting on the highest quality setting.  Too long...feels like 5-10 secs until the camera is ready to shoot again.<br />2. (gripe that I can live with)The camera is a little fatter than a lot of point and shoot subcompacts and not quite small enough to fit in your front pants pocket.<br />3. Can't transfer video taken with the camera via wifi..(why not, Sony?)<br />4.  (Small gripe)Have to plug the camera in to charge the battery, (personally I would have preferred a separate charger, where you can take the battery out of the camera to charge it.)<br />5. Transferring photos with the sony play memories app can be a little cumbersome the first couple times before you are used to it.<br /><br />So many people take photos with their smart phones today, but know if you get this camera you are definitely getting a better product.  I would definitely recommend this camera to a friend, and maybe consider buying another one for myself to control remotely if I can find some money for it.",8/15/2014

And snap, snap, snap. And it even has the option of downloading immediately to my phone and post of social media, if i want to.<br /><br />Overall happy with my purchase.",1/19/2014

It is a nice size. I am still learning how to use the camera, but have had amazing results with it so far even though most of the photos have only been taken in Superior Auto mode. Personally a little big to fit in your pocket but the cameras that are pocket size do not have the zoom capability the Sony does. I also bought the extra batteries and charger which is essential on trips. I have not used the camera for an extended period of time so I have not really pushed it to the limits. My main goal when buying this camera was to be able to take action shots and video of my 3 year old son. So far it has performed excellent. The only negative is the button position on the top and the LCD is almost useless to see what you are shooting in bright light,.<br /> With the Sony Play Memories software that is free from the Sony website you can edit photos and videos on your computer. What I like best about this software is we can take videos of my son and then select any frame and save it as a picture. Also, the WiFi works very well to quickly get a photo from the camera to your cellphone so you can send it to family and friends either by text or email. Make sure to get a super fast class 10 memory card, or you may not find the read/write speed fast enough.",1/20/2014

I like to take pictures but rarely get very artsy with it.  My problem was that I was quickly getting tired of the inadequacies of my previous camera.  It was a good small multipurpose camera but too often I missed getting the picture I wanted because it was either too slow or just didn't have the capability to do what I wanted it to do.  When I shopped for a new camera I looked extensively at larger cameras in the 18 to 24 ounce range.  After reading a review on Amazon about one of those cameras I decided I wanted something smaller.  As the person said, it was a great camera but whenever they went out to take pictures they would look at it, decide it was too large and then grab a smaller camera.  I knew it would be that way with me also.  I wanted a camera with at least a 20X zoom that would be easy to use and would fit in my pocket.  I narrowed it down to this one and two others.  Based on overall reviews on Amazon and reviews I read on photography sites I opted for this one even though it was more expensive than the others.  I have not been disappointed.  I used this at my daughters wedding and then again on a trip we took to New Orleans afterwards.  It has done everything extremely well.  It is very easy to use and easy to navigate to all of the functionality it has and there is a lot.  All I know is that people were impressed with the pictures I was able to get given lighting conditions at the wedding.  Of course this has a 30X zoom, which is greater than I probably needed but the zoom is fantastic and there were very few instances where shaking was a problem.  In fact I can only think of one.  Shaking had been a problem with my previous camera which had a markedly smaller zoom capacity.  There is still a lot for me to learn about the camera but the beauty of it is the camera when left to it's own devices takes exceptionally good pictures so I can take my time playing with the functionality.  Just a couple of words about some of the other functionality of the camera.  I asked a friend of mine who knew nothing about the camera to take a movie of the wedding ceremony.  It came out extremely well even down to being able to hear everything that was said.  I tried the panorama functionality in New Orleans and nothing could have been easier.  I was used to having to stitch things together with my old camera.  With this one you simply sweep the camera across the area.  Nothing could be easier and it worked very well.  I wasn't very interested in WIFI.  It isn't difficult at all to hook this to your computer or pull the memory card and put it in the computer but I tried it out anyway.  It was easy to set up and surprisingly worked very well.  I had set up a WIFI connection for a friend of mine's camera and found it cumbersome and very slow.  This was easy and relatively fast.  BTW my friend sent back their camera.  I'll probably still mostly transfer pictures by cable because it is easy and faster but it's nice to know that you can use the WIFI if you want to.  For me and my purposes this may well be the last camera I purchase.  I can't imagine needing more.  I'm very happy with the purchase and would recommend it to anyone.",10/24/2013

I bought this camera as a 'beginner's' camera as someone who has just recently been introduced to bird watching and taking pictures. In many ways I do love this camera. Here is my $0.02c:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-The pictures are crystal clear and there are a lot of options to choose from-took me a while to figure them all out.<br />-It's size allows you to put it anywhere-purse, bag, hand, etc. but I ended up buying a carrying case for it.<br />-It's not heavy at all-very comfortable even when aiming for a long time.<br />-Love the bluetooth option and I send my pictures to my phone or computer. LOVE this feature. It's pretty fast copying the pictures.<br />-For selfie lover's out there-you can take selfies with this camera.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-At times when zooming out/in - the zoom takes a second or two before it responds, with the button pressed all the way in to zoom. If you are in a hurry to take a picture-this can be problematic.<br />-Randomly, and without me figuring out how I do this, a little green light flashes on the lower left corner and all photos that I take after that little green light magically appears come out blurry. I cannot tell you the amount of time I have spent on-line and in the manual trying to figure out what this is and how to not have it appear. Ever. I cannot tell you why this happens. It's maddening beyond words to have the camera working just fine for weeks, then you're out taking tons of photos of birds/wildlife/life and it pops up and I am royally done-for!<br />-The installed manual is very, very basic and won't answer any questions that might pop up as a result of use. It's more a quick start guide telling you what your basic features are.<br />-This camera's screen is totally worthless in the sun (common for these screens) and the viewfinder is more expensive than the camera itself! Incredible!<br />-More often than I care to admit, when taking photosof moving objects, they come out blurry.",6/14/2015

Something must be broken in there. It isn't the SD card, as it fits perfectly fine into my computer.  Sony fixed the SD card slot issue and sent it back. That was cool.

My old NIkon L120 was great for outdoor shots, but I had trouble taking good indoor photos with the zoom.

More over the screw mount was positioned so you can not have it mounted and use the HDMI port or access the memory / batteries.<br />The buttons were very sensitive making setting changes when shooting. The top dials were too stiff, needing more than 2 fingers to move. The menu system is truly hard to navigate and configure. Wifi worked when it wanted to, again it dropped connection to my cell phone during a tranfer... not good.

The 20MP resolution is impressive, and the HD video quality is equally awesome.

While I love all the features, after less than a year of use the flash gave out.  I think the wire to the pop-up flash broke, as there was a spark from the black of the flash and a popping noise.  I'm a bit miffed at Sony as this is the second camera in under 2 years with major problems, and since my original warranty is up, they won't fix it for free.

I realize that's kind of silly, since learning more would make it more likely that I would take better photos, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.<br /><br />Anyway, I took this camera on a vacation to Morocco in May 2014. I loved it. The pictures with the full 60x zoom came out beautifully, as did my many photos of insects and flowers. All my photos of the landscape and buildings also came out beautifully. My friend has a $3k DSLR, and my macro photos came out as nicely as his. I am VERY happy will all of these photos. I didn't take a lot of video, but I am very happy with the capability to take stills while shooting video.<br /><br />My portraits of people, on the other hand, are often out of focus. It's hard to tell on the screen, so I didn't know until I got home that they were fuzzy. I used the auto setting for all my photos. Since this might be (probably is) user error, I'm not docking stars based on this.<br /><br />I did play with the sport/rapid shoot setting a bit. I was not happy with this setting. The screen and photos are extremely dark and, though it can take 10 photos/second, it stops after one second and takes a good thirty seconds to load the photos onto the memory card. To me this sort of defeats the purpose.<br /><br />The only other issue can be the size, but it's obviously smaller than an SLR and the photos are much better than the smaller, cheaper point-and-shoots.<br /><br />One last thing:  one of the best parts about this camera is that the pop-up flash is very reminiscent of Johnny 5 from Short Circuit.",6/22/2014

For this the trade offs were not where I was most concerned. Everyone thought the pictures I took were right out of National Geographic (I was on safari for two weeks). I thought the size was good. Very solid feel.  it fit into my front pants pockets fine, but I don't wear tight jeans and generally wore cargo pants or something similar.  I was taking picture like crazy and there is no way the battery lasted for 400 pictures. That is because if you take videos or view you picture, or edit  or delete them, it is easy to use up power. Having a spare battery is smart idea. I go it the night before I left. Bad idea. So it  was on the job training. Not recommended.  Picture quality is great, You can reduce pixels to 10 MP and get great picture (no noticeable difference to the human eye in pics 8.5 x 11 or less)and faster time between shots. 20 MB seemed to take a while, which is a problem if you are shooting special moments (Like cheetahs taking down a Wildebeest or you kid being so cute).  The intelligent auto mode was really effective in taking almost any type of picture. There are also other modes to cover special circumstances (Low light mode without tripod was great) including food and soft skin (why?).  Taking movies was also a plus. HD mode is awesome. It also does MP4 which is important if you are going to post or otherwise share videos<br /><br />I was a professional photographer in my day and a avid travel photographer today. I would sum it like this. Great superzoom, easy to get started, if you just keep it in intelligent auto mode or you can do whole bunch of other very cool stuff if you have the inclination, time, and patience to search for \\""how to instructions\\"".

I am very computer literate and have been doing pro-sumer level photography for many many years (I'm 60).  This camera has some really nice features in terms of taking pictures, but it has WAY too much junk included which increases the price unreasonably.  The wi-fi method of getting pictures out of the camera insists on using ONLY Sony's software, which wants to control every picture on your computer, in my case tens of thousands.  It takes forever to just open up.  It also makes my preferred photo manipulation software not run (Paint Shop Pro), so I removed it from the computer.  Now the wi-fi won't send pictures; actually I'm fine with that as I am happy using a USB connection.  However that was very difficult to set up, involving a lot of menu diving.  It won't be something that I'll be willing to do regularly, which means I have to set the camera so that it won't charge with a USB.  Actually I can live with that, but the problem is that I have paid for features that I can't use simply because they are too complex and hard to manipulate, and the software is too automatic.<br />--There is no manual.  The instructions are semi-helpful, but don't run correctly in my (Chrome) browser.  Downloading the .pdf file helped, and that is possible (now).  It is completely included in the camera itself, extremely inconvenient to access, and you can't fiddle with the camera while reading as the camera only does one thing at a time.  BAD.<br />--No Macro lens.  There is a macro setting buried deeply in the menus.  I haven't figured out how to use it.<br />--All sorts of options are included for altering your pictures in the camera.  First, you are working with a 3 inch screen here and can't tell what you are doing.  Second, they are dumb.  Anyone who needs this sort of camera most likely already is adept at photo manipulation software.  This should be left out and the cost lowered.<br />--Picture quality is pretty good for a compact camera; however the menu diving to get the settings right takes so long that the picture opportunities are lost.  Presumably this will improve with use.<br />--I would prefer a slightly smaller camera, but the large zoom may make it worthwhile.  I haven't really needed the zoom yet so am not in love with it yet. :)",1/18/2014

Awesome zoom (Everything is so near)..I mostly used this camera in iA (or iA+) mode and managed to take decent pictures,  Awesome battery, Wifi work well,  GPS work well...3D pictures work well  You can charge battery with micro usb cable, same with most phones and tablet..which is huge plus. And this is where love part ends and hate part begin..this camera is missing the most important thing the image quality..Image quality is absolutely abysmal, pathetic,  this is purely because of slow lense, small sensor,  and to much in camera sharpening.   First the Lens : HX50v has SONY brand lens, not Carl-Zessis optics which are available on other RX series..The lens is listed as F/3.5 with 11 elements in 10 groups  however in real life this lens is much slower more like F/4.0 with 12 or 14 elements. Note that higher the number of elements the more light camera need for picture.  I get to this by comparing against 5+yr old panasonic TZ-5 & Kodak Z812. IN same light, Same Zoom condition..And both these camera's capture much clearer & vibrant pictures  while SONY's pictures looked like water color painting.    Sensor :  Sony claim it has 1/2.3\\"" EXMOR sensor..Well I feel its even smaller sensor. because indoor/medium light ( well lit indoor not low light)..I compared Sony with Kodak Z812 at  ISO400, F5.6 & 1/250sec,  Kodak was miles ahead in picture quality.   And then I compared Panasonic and Sony in iA mode.. Panasonic's image was much better   SONY was fastest of 3 camera..but it is competing with very old horses..    In Camera Sharpening : Too much in camera sharpening by SONY...  ISO Limit :  SONY does not have any way to specify ISO Limit, in iA+ Mode many times camera ended up using ISO 3200 in reasonable light  this with Sony's sharpening resulted in unusable pictures.    Finally focus :  I see some ghosting at random places in pictures and subject appear out of focus, this is especially visible when you have subject in front of lush green background (Outdoor pictures after rain). This is very prominent, I dont know why is that    All in all, if you are planning to run a detective agency or plan on using camera as binoculars..this camera is for you..however if image quality if your main concern..you wont get best image in auto mode, may be if you are pro or semi pro  photographer you might get good pictures in manual mode..    And Sony support, if you are reading this. for next revision of this camera please bring in faster Zesis lense F/3.0 or so and a bigger sensor 1/1.8 or 1/2.0  and you will have best camera in history of digital camera's and consumers will have real little brother of RX.. series.",9/3/2014

For those that have or had the Sony DSC HX9V, you will find this camera a distinct upgrade! Fitting in the same belt pouch, I am grateful that this version is far superior to the 9V, which was so fragile that the screen broke because it fell out of the pouch into the camera bag! In addition, you will notice an additional &#34;EV&#34; knob at the top: giving you instant access to increase or decrease the exposure value by 2 stops! HANDY! The multi-function flash bracket on top functions for flash, input for a stereo mic, and where you attach an electric viewfinder; all of which are quite pricey....right now anyway. The tracking feature is very handy. But what is very difficult to believe is its ability to take hand held low light pictures! Compared to other pocket cameras, NONE can manage hand held low light shots like this one can!! Yesterday I took a full frame  picture of the moon, hand held! Its bigger than most pocket cameras...so maybe looses half a star for that. Otherwise, top notch! BTW....the Nanguang 54000K LED variable video light is a very useful adddition for shooting video; it slides into the flash bracket on top of the camera, and can even take the place of flash too simply by turning it on before you take a picture, and you can vary the brightness!

Here are a several: First, the User Interface is very intuitive.  Everything you select gives a brief description of what it does.  Once youΓÇÖre familiar with it, the ΓÇÿfunction guideΓÇÖ can be turned off in the menu. Second, there is an ΓÇÿIn-Camera GuideΓÇÖ that makes up several guides: Shoot/playback, Icon, Operation, and Troubleshooting.  Third, the camera has wireless capability which allows you to transfer pictures to your PC without removing the SD card, connect the camera to your smart phone to use the phone as a remote to control the camera or transfer pictures to your smart phone, and you can view pics on a TV via wifi.  There is also a Movie Mode on the dial that is a little different than just pressing the movie button on the back.  The Movie mode has an intelligent auto mode or you can select a particular scene mode to shoot video.  There are plenty of filters to play with and you can retouch photos in-camera.  The HX-50 is extremely feature rich (it took me a couple of days to familiarize myself with it).  For example: if you take photos using the burst mode they are grouped together in the playback mode and if you tilt your camera left or right the burst of photos will play like a movie clip; or you can change the focus setting to allow yourself to manually change the focus spot before taking pictures.<br /><br />I love cameras but try not to compare apples to oranges -not all cameras are equal.  Manufacturers build cameras with a particular consumer in mind.  It is up to you to figure out what you want in a camera and then find the camera that suits your needs.  Look at what your habits are.  Do you want to lug around a DSLR with multiple lenses?  Do you wish you had a larger zoom but still want the camera small?  Do you like not having to worry about the settings and just snap a nice picture? Maybe you do, but have decided you want to start learning how the settings (f-stop, etc) really work and donΓÇÖt know where to start.  Or maybe you just need a nice small well rounded camera you can carry with you all the time.  This camera has manual settings that will allow you to start expanding on your photography skills and it also has plenty of filters and features for you to experiment with.  No it doesnΓÇÖt have RAW capability and no, you will not get DSLR quality photos.  But what you will get is a very capable camera that handles weird lighting situations extremely well, takes fantastic macro shots, and great zoomed shots that you will want to share with family and friends.  And if you decide to decorate your house, instead of buying artwork, these photos can be made into large prints to hang on the wall.",1/1/2014

I take a lot of photos at my kids plays without a flash so sadly this newer model lacks the ability its predecessor had to capture those moments. At a wedding reception this past weekend the majority of my indoor shots w/o a flash had blurry areas.  With a flash sometimes the subject is washed out and over exposed.  I tried playing with all the settings for this purpose and could never get the quality I had in the 20v.  I need a camera that can deliver quality photos on the fly without a lot of fiddling with settings everywhere I go.  I love Sony cameras and have had several over the years so going to try the Cybershot WX300 instead with has more powerful low light capabilities.,1/21/2014

I researched for a month trying to find the perfect point and shoot.  I chose this one because the price was decent, the features were good, and its supposed to take excellent pictures.<br /><br />Positive Thoughts about this Camera:<br />-This camera takes good photos.  Not GREAT, but good.<br />-It's easy to use<br />-Zoom is apparently &#34;really good&#34; for the price. I feel that the zoom is good, but not super super good<br />-You can go to movie taking mode with the press of 1 button<br />-You can zoom in and out while you record video<br />-You can record 1080p video<br />-You can take still images while you record video<br />-You can use your phone using the Sony app to remotely take pictures or video from around 20 feet away<br />-You can control the zoom using the phone app<br />-You can set the timer using the phone app<br />-You can adjust manual settings to take &#34;DSLR&#34; type photos (I doubt that anyone actually uses manual)<br /><br />Complaints:<br />-The pictures aren't the best.  Maybe it's my photography skills, but I've seen other point and shoots, Canon's especially, take GREAT pictures on auto.<br />-The wifi connection that the camera uses to connect to the phone isn't the best.  At 20 feet, the connection may drop if there's too much interference<br />-Pictures taken using the max optical zoom are almost cell phone quality like.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />It has a lot of great features that the avid consumer will like, but the picture quality isn't the best.  My honest opinion, get the Canon point and shoots or just spend the extra 200-300 and get the point and shoots that mimic the DSLRs.  Apparently, they have the better image sensor that will boost the quality of your pictures by a lot",4/16/2015

It's the actual camera that I have issues ...,"I've had this camera since January and the pictures are fine.  It's the actual camera that I have issues with and they're the same issues others have mentioned.<br /><br />ΓÇóThe battery door is flimsy and I have to open it often to take the memory card out to get the photos off of it (it's much quicker than using the software).  It's getting harder to slide the bar that opens it.  I used to be able to use my fingertip and now I have to use a fingernail.<br /><br />ΓÇóThe pop up flash is also VERY flimsy and having an automatic flash doesn't do you any good if you have to manually make the flash pop up.  After less than 9 months, it's gotten to the point that I have to pry the flash up with my thumbnail while pressing the button to get it to pop up.<br /><br />ΓÇóErasing a folder from the memory card while it's in my memory card reader does NOT erase it from the card so it still shows up in the list of folders but is read only.  I have to manually delete the folder with the card in the camera.  If I don't, I have to run through all of the folders listed on the card to get to the one I need.<br /><br />ΓÇóThe display is very hard to see in bright light conditions.  All of my photos are taken inside but even bright light from a skylight can be too much.<br /><br />ΓÇóI have had periodic issues with it not saving a sequence of photos.  I would take a set of pictures and then get a message that it couldn't save them and it would prompt me to recover them.  Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.  I haven't had the problem in a while but I don't know why it did it and it could be devastating to someone taking photos of a very special event only to find out that their photos weren't saved.<br /><br />ΓÇóThe menu navigation is awkward.  The most common settings I use are toward the bottom of the menu- that may not be true for everyone.  I'm also noticing that the menu navigation is getting a mind of its own- the highlight moves to another selection without being touched.<br /><br />To sum it up, I just don't think this camera is built to last.  It's only about an ounce lighter than the DSC-H10 that I replaced with it but it feels much cheaper.  The hand grip is about half as thick on this model and it just doesn't feel secure in the hand.  The DSC-H10 that this replaced lasted for 4 years and I was very happy with it until it started randomly overexposing photos.  I'll be looking for a replacement for this one by years' end.To sum it up, I just don't think this camera is built to last.

Video worked great and that was also sharper than I expected. I had a Canon SX260 but that went under water. I \\""upgraded\\"" to the Canon SX280, did the firmware, nice pictures but only 5 - 10 minutes of video. The SX280 had some real battery issues which Canon does not appear to want to address.<br /><br />The Sony HX50V/B  is a little bulkier than the Canons, but I still consider it a \\""pocket camera\\"". Slightly heavier than the 260/280 but, again, not a \\""con\\"".  If I had one objection, the snap shot process time seems a little slow and I'm using Sandisk 32GB SDHC Class 10, UHS-1 80MB/s card. Not a biggie, I just got used to it. Excellent idea for the manual pop up flash, I didn't care for having my finger pushed out of the way with the auto flash. I don't understand why people complain about the LCD screen not being bright enough, I had my screen brightness set at #4 (out of 5) at the beach on a clear day and had no problem what so ever. It can still do 10 shots per second. So, yeah, I'm sticking with this camera (for a while). I like \\""pocket cameras\\"", much more fun than luging around camera bags. Can't wait to try it out skiing.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this camera to family and friends.<br /><br />Update after a Year: Still in love with this camera! What still amazes me, is the picture quality when I crop a picture taken by zoom. Yeah, I'll keep this camera for a while or until I drop it in the water.

Now in 2014 this category has a number of contenders.  With respect to reviewers saying \\""DLSR quality\\"" for this category (it always seems to be a headline in some reviews--no matter what model), it is not true, but don't let that deter you--picture quality can be high. For this Canon 50D owner, there is plenty of pixel peeping to do, and at this level it is easy to have all sorts of technique and lens issues that predominate perceived quality.  If you want more professional results use a full size DLSR with quality glass.<br /><br />For a second camera, I wanted smaller profile and lighter weight.  More zoom than 10x.  Walk around quality.  Best picture quality with acceptance of sensor size and image quality associated with big zoom small profile cameras.  I really wanted an articulated (ability to front face) view screen.  Wi-fi is nice since I have used my iphone for quick photos to add to texts--a fun option.  I do not really care about touch screens.  I do not really care about video, although this camera has lots of video options available.<br /><br />I have had a variety of cameras and currently run with a Canon 50D (and the expensive heavy lenses associated with it).  For a compact I was using a Canon G12 which was sold to buy a Canon G1X (first gen).<br /><br />I certainly loved the G1X for its low light capability, articulated screen, ability to accept filters, and known menu structure.  I did not love the macro and focusing issues.  And, while I did not really like the size and weight of the G1X, I would have purchased the 2nd generation if it had been closer to $600 rather than $800--even without a big zoom.  (Canon got the G1X right on the second gen, fixing the macro and a number of auto focus issues).<br /><br />With the money I received via Amazon for my G1X, initially I was considering a Sony RX100 III.  It has the image quality from a large sensor and a front facing view available.  The lower end zoom and high price drove me to consider other options.  I almost felt that if I was going to spend $800 I might as well just upgrade my Canon DLSR... or buy another G1X.<br /><br />Other comparable cameras considered:<br /><br />Panasonic DMC-ZS40K  (great lens, nice camera, but a bit over budget)<br />Canon PowerShot SX700  (nice camera-- strong contender for prior Canon owners needing smaller and higher zoom)<br />Sony WX350  (no full manual operation available and 20x instead of 30x, super price)<br /><br />None of these cameras has an articulating front view screen.  (The current Sony HX50 does not have this option either).  It was disappointing to realize this option was not going to be available to me.<br /><br />Sony advantages to me:  Perceived image quality via reviews and in actual use: Comparisons show very good pictures in auto and manual modes.  Lots of built in image options, along with full manual.  For this HDR user, the ability to shoot three bracketed photos is great.  (An in camera double exposure HDR option is also present).  Full auto is pretty nice, just point and shoot... producing images most people will find very acceptable inside and out.  Standard color processing in full auto is a bit more saturated than flat, most likely desirable in a camera like this--and you can dial it back.  Super zoom--30X.  Auto focus is truly great, almost reading your mind about what you want to focus on.  Macro quality and focal distances are very acceptable at about 3 cm, maybe a little closer.  Ergonomically:  Size and weight make this a great carry around camera.  Nicely textured and molded handhold allows single hand use.  Menu structure and ease of use is OK for this prior Canon user.  The on camera help file is really great--even allowing you to directly jump to a feature you are interested in directly from the file.<br /><br />Things I do not like:  The Wi-Fi connection is less than intuitive and requires a web search for procedure along with some fumbling to get it to work.  See my procedure below. The messages you get on the camera and in the software app are sometimes baffling and wrong.  Once you figure it out it is acceptable.  No NFC?<br /><br />Other consideration:  Low light capability still remains a question mark.  In current tests, with natural lighting and no flash, quality seems high.  Will a required 800 ISO in the absence of a flash keep noise to a minimum?  Another true test will come in a convention center with typical bright lights overly casting a yellow hue into most photos--will auto white balance be correct and bring things to the best color?  (The Canon G1X would not; it had to be manually set with some testing!).<br /><br />I am enjoying this new camera and finding new things to try each day!  For the price, this is a great choice.  4 stars with one knocked off for the less than intuitive Wi-Fi app.<br /><br />UPDATE 10-17-14<br />Two general comments--this camera takes great pictures inside convention centers with a variety of lighting.  The auto white balance does a great job of stabilizing color where many cameras might need tweaking to eliminate yellow cast color.  As a carry around -- with candid people picture taking -- a very nice camera.  Now the bad--at the top of this review I indicated that this was NOT an SLR.  HDR bracketed pictures confirm this contention.  Even at 100 ISO, bracketed -/+ 1 HDR post processed shots (jpg) end up grainy when magnified.  Compared to my trusty Canon 50D in the same shot(s) there is simply no comparison... the tried and true Canon SLR is superior for landscape work whether HDR or not.  I suspect this is mostly due to smaller sensor capturing images from miles away--the number of pixels is less relevant than the quality and size of those pixel, along with whatever post processing is occurring for jpgs in the Sony.

US,48359328,RN2J6HS0GDPH6,B00CDIK48U,1577919,Sony 20.4MP Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD Screen,Camera,5,28,29,N,N,Supringly capable small sensor camera with many useful bells and whistles!,"I purchased this camera with low expectations.  We have owned many digital cameras and camcorders over the past couple decades starting with cameras whose maximum resolution was VGA (640x480). We already have two previous generation small sensor \\""super zoom\\"" cameras and we also have a pocket sized camera with an optical zoom.  All three shoot \\""HD Video\\"" and when we purchased them we were happy with all of them.  I didn't see the point buying a fourth small sensor camera.  I am a gadget freak, but I am trying to reform.<br /><br />Among other things... my wife belongs to a vintage fashion club. She and her friends organize and model in fashion shows to raise money for Children's Hospital and other charitable organizations.  For many years I have been taking pictures and video of the events.  I am almost embarrassed to admit that we have several HD camcorders; sometimes I hand hold one and simultaneously record on a couple others that are set up on tripods and then combine the footage.  But it gets to be too much work, so lately for both pictures and videos my favorite device is the Sony SLT-A65 camera for which I have a number of capable lenses and accessories.<br /><br />Last week I was coerced into participating in one of the shows myself.  My wife decided that she wanted to take some photos of me in the WWII Air Corps \\""pinks and greens\\"" Uniform that I went on stage with along with a woman who was dressed as my bride.  My wife is a slightly built woman; she found the A65 and the large zoom lens I had mounted on it that day to be large and unwieldy.  I normally carry a backpack full of lenses, a tripod and other accessories when we take the A65 somewhere.  My wife pointed out that on most occasions we do not have it along.<br /><br />Our other smaller cameras, cell phones, and tablets take pictures that are acceptable for many types of occasions.  As I mentioned they are getting a little older and their capabilities obviously are very limited compared to more modernDSLR type cameras. Sometimes we still get really good pictures from them, but after you are spoiled by a camera with a large sensor and a lot of modern features it can be frustrating to use them. So my feeling was that we did not need or even want another small camera.  But my wife felt differently and she went on the lookout for a camera that she would feel comfortable using.  She wanted a camera small enough that we would actually have it with us most of the time, but something that would capture better images than what we could get with our phones or other older small cameras.<br /><br />When my wife pointed out the DSC-HX50V camera to me at a local retailer I remained skeptical.  I asked her once again why we would want another camera with a sensor just a fraction of an inch larger than the one found in an iPhone? (1/3\\"" vs 1/2.3\\"")  But most of the time when she is happy I am happy.  So after a few days of mulling it over we got one.  She was right and I was wrong.  The camera is amazing.  We have had it just a couple of weeks, but it keeps suprising me.  I have become a believer.  The camera just takes excellent photos.  The videos are also incredible.  Because of the camera's relatively deep depth of field, focusing for video is not as much of a challenge for it.<br /><br />The HX50V has in camera HDR (High Dynamic Range) processing that works incredibly well.  You press the button, it takes several pictures using different settings and combines them to give you a better picture than the sensor would normally be capable of taking.  It also has the external multipurpose shoe.  I bought an adapter so that I can use a third party external flash and also my radio flash trigger that can set off multiple flashes simultaneously. This feature is far more handy than most people might realize.  I have been using an inexpensive flash that works with the automatic TTL features with my Sony A65.  The TTL works with this camera as well firing off a test flash to a asses thelighting and adjust the power of the flash.<br /><br />There is only one caveat with using an external flash.  To get it to work one most first open the internal flash with the camera in a mode that will use the flash.  Then turn on the external flash.  Then close the internal flash.  If the camera goes into standby the procedure needs to be repeated.<br /><br />Most impressive of course is the zoom lens combined with the great image stabilization.  I was able to take pictures from the Space Needle of ships and cranes at the Port of Seattle approximately two miles away for a friend of mine.  He has an import export business and wanted pictures for his web site.  The images turned out great handheld without a tripod.  My A65 has good in body stabilization also, but my longest lens is 300mm.  I usually put the camera on a tripod if I want good results in full zoom.  So this little camera has incredible reach even without a tripod.  Some of the HDR features can be used to make the pictures turn out clearer than with image stabilization alone.  This also allows one to get clear images in low light.<br /><br />One of the features that I didn't realize would be useful for us was the wifi.  As it turns out it is extremely convenient to be able to send your images from your camera to your phone or tablet when you are out and about.  My wife set up a display at a museum recently and it was very nice to show her the pictures in a larger format while we were still there.  You can also control the shutter and zoom from your phone while seeing the scene live.  Then the picture you take is instantly uploaded.  I didn't realize that it could also display a slide show on our HDTV wirelessly through our Sony Blu-Ray player.  Of course you can also upload to your computer through wifi as well... which if you haven't taken hundreds of photos can be convenient.<br /><br />So to summarize... the DSC-HX50V is a great camera.  It is small enough that when you see something that you wishyou could take a picture of you might just have it with you.  The pictures actually come out looking better than you expect that they will much of the time.  Instead of feeling disappointed that we failed to capture the essence that we were hoping for we seem to be saying \\""wow\\"" that is almost as good as being there.  And the extra features are quite amazing also and surprisingly useful.<br /><br />So that is kind of the end of my review, but I also wanted to discuss large sensor vs small sensor cameras.  It is the small sensor that makes it possible for this camera to have the huge amount of zoom that it does.  A full size 720mm lens would be very large and expensive and I am unaware of any that can go full wide angle as the one that comes on this camera can.  The technology behind the sensor on this little camera is quite amazing... it is obviously much more efficient with the smaller amount of light it is sampling than larger sensors are.  Also the digital trickery that the tiny computer inside the camera is able to perform to get the most out of the sensor is quite amazing as well.<br /><br />A camera with a small sensor currently cannot do everything that a camera with a large sensor can do.  Cameras with larger sensors take larger lenses that have larger apertures and they can collect much more light.  This obviously helps with their low light capabilities, but even more importantly from an artistic perspective... without digital trickery cameras with small sensors generally can not achieve as narrow a depth of field (or focus). A narrow depth of field is one of the primary tools that photographers use to create beautiful artistic photos. That is one of the primary reasons why in this time of miniaturized everything you still see photographers running around with giant cameras with massively large lenses.<br /><br />There are excellent articles discussing this if you search for \\""Full Frame Equivalence\\"" in a search engine.<br /><br />I will try to summarize here.  A camera with a \\""full frame\\"" 35mm sensor has a sensor that is 36mm by 24mm or 864 sq. mm.  My beloved Sony SLT-A65 has an APS-C sensor that is 23.5mm by 15.6mm or 366 sq mm.  The DSC-HX50V has a sensor that is 6.2mm by 4.6mm or 28.52 sq mm.  An iPhone has a sensor that is 3.56mm by 2.68mm or 9.5 sq mm.  I think that it is fairly obvious to everyone that a tiny sensor is going to be working with a lot less light.  Small sensors must be much more sensitive than the larger sensors... and they are, but of course at this time they still cannot match the performance of a much larger sensor.  But their is another issue that is more vexing and one that is true but somewhat misleading in the specifications.<br /><br />The front of the lens on the DSC-HX50V has  printed on it, \\""3,5 -6,3/4,3-129\\"".  The multi-purpose zoom lens that is currently mounted on my SLT-A65 has printed on it, \\""18-200mm 1 : 3.5-6.3\\"".  On the HX50V the numbers 4,3-129 are referring to the zoom length of the lens which is 4.3mm to 129mm.  Because of the \\""crop factor\\"" which is referring to the much smaller dimensions of the sensor as compared to a full frame 35mm sensor, the 35mm equivalent for the lens is marketed as having as 24mm to 720mm. This calculation is made by all major camera manufacturers and fairly well understood.<br /><br />The numbers that people have a harder time with are the \\""3,5-6,3\\"" and the \\""3.5-6.3\\"" which on both lenses is referring to the maximum \\""f-stop\\"" for the lens at full wide angle and full zoom.  This is referring to the aperture which is how wide the blades that control how much light passes through the camera can open.  The numbers on the two lenses above are the same, so one would assume that the openings would be the same size, but this is not the case.  The opening size controls not only how much light can pass through the lens in a given amount of time, but also the depth of focus or field. If the lens has a larger opening the depth of field is shallower... less of thepicture is in focus.  If you have a smaller opening more of the picture is in focus.<br /><br />For pictures of landscapes, mountains and many other types of scenes... having most of the picture in focus is desirable.  However photographers covet a shallow depth of field for beautiful portraits, close-ups and artistic control over the image.  Photographers pay huge amounts of money for lenses that have as wide an aperture as possible.  It is the actual dimensions of the aperture not \\""f-stop\\"" that largely determines depth of focus.<br /><br />How is f-stop determined? If a 50mm lens has a maximum aperture of 25mm, it would be an f/2 lens. For the HX50V at its widest angle the lens is 4.3mm and the widest f-stop is 3.5  so the actual opening is 4.3mm / 3.5 f-stop = 1.22mm.  For comparison widest angle and the widest f-stop on the lens currently on my A65 is 18mm / 3.5 = 5.14mm.  At full zoom the HX50V lens is  129mm / 6.3f-stop = 20.47mm for its widest opening.  At full zoom the lens on my A65 is 200mm / 6.3 f-stop = 31.74mm.<br /><br />For my A65 which has an APS-C sensor and a 1.5 \\""crop factor\\"" compared to a 35mm camera at my widest angle the 35mm equivalent f-stop is 3.5 x 1.5 = 5.25 f-stop, but on the HX50V which has a \\""crop factor\\"" of 5.6 as advertised by Sony so the equivalent f-stop is 3.5 x 5.6 = 19.6. One of the most popular positive reviews on Amazon laments the loss of the higher f-stops which he mistakenly believed was 6.3 but is actually f-stop 8.  If you multiply 8 x the crop factor of 5.6 the actual equivalent 35mm \\""f-stop\\"" is 44.8.  So his concern may not have been as valid as he felt it was.<br /><br />In practical terms what this means is that if you want to get a photo with a subject that is in focus and a background which has an attractive blur (known as \\""bokeh\\"")... you basically must zoom the lens in.  This allows the aperture to open up enough at the widest F stop in Aperture mode to achieve a narrow depth of field.  I have been able to get whatI consider nice \\""bokeh\\"" using this camera this way.  This was pleasant suprise... I didn'the realize it would even be possible with a small sensor camera.<br /><br />The reason that we can get as much performance as we do out of tiny sensors is that they tend to be more efficient at processing light than larger sensors.  And with small processors that work with them are able to use digital trickery to get more out of them.  What really matters is the final output.  These days tiny, relatively inexpensive devices are able to turn out much higher quality images than was possible just a few years ago.",4/22/2014

I struck gold with the HX50.  This is my first Sony camera, having largely stuck to Panasonic and Canons in the past, but I found it very pleasant to work with, intuitive to use, standard Apature/Shutter priority settings, and did pretty much everything I wanted it to do, and a bit more, all in very small package.<br /><br />The zoom is 30x, or 720mm, and is as good as my old PowerShot SX500, also a 30x/720mm superzoom.  No, the pictures, especially at full zoom, won't be all that great at full crop magnification, but you shouldn't expect that at this price range.  It also takes considerably better video than the old SX500, at 1080p/60fps, with much better face tracking, auto focus and superior audio.  Speaking of auto, if you're lazy or don't know much about photography and want to leave everything in Auto, the HX50 does an admirable job getting settings right.  I was very happy with my low light shots and video with everything on Auto, with or w/o flash.<br /><br />The small package deserves extra praise.  My old superzooms gave me 50x or more optical zooms, but the tradeoff was you had to dedicate space to them, whether in a special bag, around your neck on its strap, on a tripod, basically, they weren't casual picture takers.  If you're not a great photo enthusiast, but just want to take some pictures... okay, your phone is likely enough.  But your phone doesn't have optical zoom, and if you're on vacation, or going to a show, there are times when you just want to be able to casually take something out of your pocket (or purse, messenger bag, whatever) to get some close up shots that your phone won't do as good a job at.  That the HX 50 does this plus emulate most of the features of a &#34;full sized&#34; superzoom rates it 5 stars from me despite some nitpiks I'll get to below.<br /><br />I haven't extensively used the WiFi and GPS functions (mostly to conserve battery life, more on this below), but it's good to know they are available.  You can control the camera with your smart phone as well, though again, I didn't test these aspects very much. Battery life isn't great; I'll definitely be picking up a spare, with a dedicated charger. That you can charge directly in the camera is nice, in that I got to charge it off my spare battery pack w/o having to find a wall socket. Still, especially if you're taking a lot of videos, the battery won't come close to lasting a full day. I also found it disturbing that the camera would get pretty hot after taking HD video for over 30min or so.<br /><br />So to sum up:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good-to-great pictures & video (for this price level)<br />Very compact for a 30x<br />Good Auto mode, but has decent manual settings for the semi-enthusiast<br /><br />Con:<br />So-so battery, runs hot<br />Doesn't come with a dedicated chargern't extensively used the WiFi and GPS functions (mostly to conserve battery life, more on this below), but it's good to know they are available.

I currently use a Sony A-57 DSLR and love it.  I have a much older version of this camera (HX5V) that I still use, but it's getting long in the tooth.    I bought the HX50V so I could travel light on a short trip we were taking to Hawaii where I didn't want to lug a DSLR around.  I love the feature set of this camera, which closely mirrors the A-57.  The long zoom reach is attractive for a vacation camera.  Although a little bulky, it will fit in a jacket pocket or in cargo shorts, so the size is good for travel.    So, what's the disappointment?  As others have pointed out, the screen is essentially unusable outdoors, making it hard to frame shots.  This also renders most of the features worthless since you can't see the on-screen settings.  It renders the zoom worthless as well:  you can't zoom in on something you can't see.    I also had some misc. issues, e.g., the camera froze up while shooting and I had to remove the battery to force a reboot so the zoom would retract.  In fact, I had to remove/reinsert the battery a few times before I could retract the zoom.  The PlayMemories software for importing pix is also kludgy, but I knew that from my previous Sony experience.    How's the picture quality?  So far, my results have been variable.  Some pix are pretty good, many are mediocre.  I'd give it about a 50-60% success rate.  Unfortunately, when you're outdoors, you can't judge the quality because the screen is so washed out.  So, on my trip, I'd shoot pictures during the day, then review them at the hotel at night.  Oops, there's some bad ones!  I wish I would have seen that when I shot them...I could have adjusted and re-shot.  But, once you're back inside, it's too late to fix.    Video quality is pretty good.  No complaints there.    I really want to like this camera, but so far I can't.  The feature set is great, the zoom is great, but thescreen kills it.  If the picture quality was outstanding, it might outweigh the disadvantages, but it's really no better than a good smartphone as far as I can tell.    I'm taking a short business trip next week.  I'll take the camera with me and post an update.  I'm crossing my fingers but I have a hunch this sucker is getting returned.  Fortunately, I bought it from Amazon so that process is painless.      **** UPDATE 12/13/14:  I ultimately gave up on this camera and returned it.  I had it about 3 weeks and used it in a variety of settings:  bright outdoors, overcast outdoors, indoor with flash, indoor low light, etc.  I used it for landscapes, portraits, group scenes, etc. I shot mostly stills but did have a chance to do some video.  I found that for most of the shooting I did, this camera just didn't cut it.  It mostly had to do with ergonomics:  the camera is too big for most pockets, can't see the screen outdoors, movie button too easy to accidentally push, flimsy battery and USB covers, flash button hard to activate, features hard to access in the various menus, etc. The picture quality was also highly variable for me.  Some pix were pretty good, most were not.  I'd say about 15-20% were keepers.  I have 2 other Sony cameras and I love them, but this one is an oddball...it just didn't work for me.",11/28/2014

It has made picture taking easy.  I've gone through about 600 shots so far and the camera has been wonderful.  I use the WiFi operation in conjunction with the PlayMemories app on our Nexus 7 tablet to take remote shots of my wife's Etsy items.  I find I'm settling on the iA+ mode most of the time, with the rare exception that I'll use P-mode to shoot with a lower ISO, increased sharpness, or refined exposure area (when taking moon shots, for example).  The wide angle lens has been great for taking interior shots, and the bokeh effect is easy to achieve.<br /><br />The biggest complaint I would have is that the screen is really difficult to see in full sun.  It's hard to tell how well exposed your photos are because of this.  However, I am pleased to say that when I pop the memory card in the computer, the shots are exposed well about 95% of the time.  I've been keeping the exposure dial at one click below 0 (towards -1) to help make sure my exposures aren't on the high side.<br /><br />Another minor quibble is that when using the WiFi control, you're unable to change exposure, ISO, aperture, exposure time, etc.  This seems like something Sony could correct with simple software changes, and I encourage them to do so!  It would greatly add to the functionality of the camera.<br /><br />I would recommend this camera in a heartbeat to anyone!<br /><br />Original review:<br />I spent at least a week of research before finally settling on this camera after returning the disappointing [[ASIN:B00DY2Y28M Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 60x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black)]].  Overall, the Sony produced the best color, detail, and appearance on sites like Flickr (concentrating on the technical specs and \\""reviews\\"" was about worthless).<br /><br />After receiving the camera and spending some time with it, I am noticing the same delightful results I saw in the photos taken by other HX50V users.  The small package is fantastic, and the handling is pretty decent.  Focus is fast with the auto-tracking function a bit hard to set but useful.  The zoom range is great and goes about as far as possible without the use of a tripod thanks I suppose to the optical image stabilization.  I've uploaded a photo of the moon taken handheld that demonstrates the abilities of this camera.  I highly recommend this camera, with your next best superzoom choice potentially being the [[ASIN:B006K5521Q Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX10V 18.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Camera with 16x Optical Zoom and 3.0-inch LCD (Black) (2012 Model)]] which is, unfortunately, a little outside my price range.s.

After all the best camera is no good if you do not have it or the right lenses with you. So what is the problem? The LCD screen that you need to frame the picture washes out badly in any kind of strong sunlight. I missed a number of pictures on my most recent cruise because I was unable to see well enough to frame the picture. In some cases I missed the intended subject completely. There is of course a fix, buy the electronic viewfinder but it is as expensive if not more that the camera (does that make sense?). It also impacts the portability of the camera which is one of the nice features. A way to control the brightness of the LCD might improve the situation but I could not find one. I noticed that my iPhone did a better job of dealing with the light and glare than the camera did so it can be done better.<br /><br />Bottom line is a nice camera with good portability but if you are buying a camera with a lot of zoom, you are probably planning to use it outside and there it has major problems with using the LCD in any kind of bright light.

Pictures in low light conditions also turned out very nicely, so no issues there.<br /><br />I do have issue with the video feature though. It does 1920x1080@60p which is excellent, but typically only needed for high speed action like scooter tricks or so. So to save space 1920x1080@30p would be a better choice ... except that choice does not exist? Instead I can choose 1920x1080@60i which uses pretty much the same space, but now I need to find converter software to de-interlace, while still maintaining the quality (also needed to convert .MTS to .MP4 or .MOV). I already wasted a day trying all sorts of different apps but have not found anything yet, some don't de-interlace period, some do a horrendous hack job and some reduce the pixels to 640x480 ...

She absolutely loved it. This is much more than just a simple point-and-shoot camera. It has the ability to go completely automatic or manual, and the presets for scenes or portraits are both handy and well programmed. 20.4 megapixels is a bit of overkill, but it gives you an idea of just how good the pictures are that this camera takes.<br /><br />I was particularly impressed with its performance in low light. Most of the time she kept the flash off and got stunning pictures of the interiors of things that would have been impossible with a less versatile camera.<br /><br />I deducted one star for ergonomics. The programming dial is very easy to turn inadvertently while using the camera which will change the mode of the camera without the user realizing they've done so. In addition, there is a multiple shot feature with the HX50V that is a bit difficult to use. My wife often found herself taking three or four shots of a scene instead of one, and it was because the close proximity of the controls on the back of the camera allow for this setting to be engaged without realizing it. Once she was aware of what she was doing, and made sure her hands were placed properly, she had much better luck with this feature.<br /><br />While you can use this camera out of the box, you'll need to read the manual if you intend to take advantage of many of the camera's advanced features.

Without using the flash, my wife routinely could take 100-200 pictures a day and only needed to charge the battery every other day.

The 20 MP sensor produces great pictures and videos. The size is small enough for your pocket.  For video, I like the 60x zoom that allows me to record my kids soccer games.  From 80 feet away, when taking a picture, I can read Nike on my kid's soccer shoes. I also purchased the Sony ECM-XYST1m external mic that fits in the hot shoe and uses the camera's battery.  This records excellent sound and avoids the zoom noise when I record the kids piano recitals.  The battery lasts for 2 hours recording video, in 30 minute increments.  Recording in MP4 makes it easier to edit. The low light recording is surprisingly good.  There is a built in flash, with an option for an external one.  For the creative photographer, there are a lot of extra programming options.  The on screen help is intuitive.  I have yet to use the WiFi, I'm sure it would be useful.  The screen is a bit small and dim, but once the pictures/videos are uploaded to my computer, the quality is amazing.  Overall I am delighted to have discovered this camera.  Not many camera stores are aware of the punch this camera packs.  I highly recommend it.",12/4/2013

I have several digital cameras, but the Sony is my all-time favorite. I enjoy using the various filters and options and never leave the house without it. I've been taking pictures for about 60 years and never enjoyed photography as much as I do with my Sony. If I had to give up all my cameras but one, the Sony would definitely be the keeper. It does many (or most) of the things the larger digital SLRs do, but it's so handy and there's no fiddling with lenses. I think it only takes two things to make great photographs -- a good eye and a good camera. I have a pretty good eye after all these years, and I have a damn good camera.",1/14/2014

My primary shooter is also a Sony, so I selected this camera so as not to have to familiarize myself with another brand's features, menu's, etc.  From that standpoint the camera is great -- if you're accustomed to Sony cameras, you'll find this one works exactly the same.  I'm also impressed with the features included in the camera -- the vast majority of Sony's advanced features can be found on this tiny little camera, making it incredibly versatile in a variety of situations.  Unfortunately, the picture quality is only so-so.  Viewed at full res, pictures show a lot of watercoloring, blur, etc.  Overall about what you'd expect out of a compact superzoom.

I loved it - it is quicker in processing than its predecessors, it is able to lock into GPS faster and more accurately, it makes great photos, the zoom is powerful. The only thing is that being wide angle, it distorts unzoomed pictures at short distance. Especially for groups of people this is annoying, but I guess, the price to pay for a lens that is equivalent to 24-720mm. Battery life is more than enough for me, and able to take hundreds of pictures a day. I don't use movies much, but is works fine, and you can zoom in and out while filming. Low light pictures are great, and most of the time you don't need the flash. For some odd reason, only the American version includes both the wifi and the GPS.

I informally compared shots between the RX100 and HX50 and didn't see a great deal of difference, except in low light situations where the RX100 was clearly better.  On the high zoom, it's a bit tricky to find the subject and get the camera to focus correctly.

This camera is slightly larger (does not fit as easily in a normal shirt pocket ... but still fits in \\""travel shirts\\"").  Battery life is fine (buy an extra battery if you're going to use it all day).  Buy the optional battery charger too; it charges the battery about three times faster.  My chief complaint is with the panorama function.  This worked beautifully in the HX7V. In the HX50V, the panorama suffers VERY badly from a reverse fisheye distortion.  For example, a straight road (going from your left to your right) now looks like a sharp \\""U\\"" with the ends further away going off at a 45 degree angle.  I don't know what Sony changed, but my old one doesn't do this at all.  This camera performs badly enough on the panorama function that I just stopped using it for that.

These are challenging situations because of the low light and movement.  IPhone 5 cameras are great under normal conditions, but the digital zoom just does not hack it for these purposes.<br /><br />I had a Canon PowerShot 300HS which is a wonderful little camera, but it lacked a sufficiently powerful optical zoom.  I upgraded to a Nikon CoolPix S3600 because it had a more powerful optical zoom and 20 megs, and it cost under $100 bucks.  The Nikon suffered from very poor focus.  It was an OK camera under normal light, but was in fact inferior for my purposes compared with the Canon.<br /><br />So bought the Sony because of the massive 30X optical zoom and the 20 megs.<br /><br />I bought the camera with the case because it was cheaper than without the case (go figure).<br /><br />I was shocked, though, when I opened the box to find that the camera was about twice as large as the Canon or Nikon.

Burst shooting is also excellent.<br /><br />The really pleasant surprise was how good it was with video.  I would say the constant focus is better than that of my beloved Canon T5i.",2/14/2015

US,40268673,RBWWZ5083SRYH,B0066DOPPG,1623033,"Stick-On WindCutter Fur Microphone Windscreen for Consumer Camcorder (Sony, Panasonic, Canon, JVC, & More)",Camera,4,1,1,N,Y,"The WindCutter Works, Sorta...","While a separate microphone offers the best solution for reducing wind noise (with an added foam cover, \\""furry\\"" cover, \\""furry\\"" cover over foam cover, or even with a blimp [for the best results]), a fur patch (like this one offered by WindCutter) can be useful for at least reducing the ill effects of wind on video sound quality. In a few tests with the Panasonic G6 with the WindCutter installed, blowing on the mic while indoors (alternating with the flash up and down - which raises the WindCutter off the mics and then down on the mics), and also outdoors in a moderate wind while doing the same, it seems to work quite well on the G6 (at least if the wind wasn't too strong...). While microphone covers theoretically will cut a bit of the high end frequency range, with trying some \\""hiss\\"" tests, its effects appeared to be minor (I couldn't hear the difference between using it and not).<br /><br />It does take a bit of \\""fitting\\"" to put the WindCutter on the Panasonic G6 without also sticking the flash down with it - but it can be done. Unfortunately, due to differences in design with the Panasonic G5 and GH3/4, it can't be fitted to those cameras as easily (or likely at all). It should fit easily on most cameras with flush mic openings that are not too large in area, with \\""flatish\\"" or gently curved mounting surfaces, and with large enough smooth areas to accommodate the (1 1/4\\"" square) patch (which was different from the one in the supplied photographs) and its included edge of sticky-tape (which is a bit over 1/8\\"" wide). It should be placed with its fur-bias facing forward, and the patch must not stick to parts that interfere with their functions. I solved a potential problem (with the rear part of the sticky strip on the bottom of the patch preventing the G6's flash from popping up) by carefully cutting the paper protecting the rear sticky part from the side sticky parts and leaving it on so that that part didn't stick to the mic's surface when the flash was raised. Unfortunately, the patch was too long front-to-back to not stick things together at the front edge (the patch must be nearly the right size for the particular camera). It was too large for the G6, so I tried cutting off a strip from its back edge, but this led to the patch beginning to come apart. I solved this by running a small bead of glue along that edge and then coloring it black to match the camera and patch, but by then the sticky material was ruined, and an attempt to use double-sided tape to repair it failed. If I keep the G6, I will likely buy another WindCutter with which I may try again with cutting the back end off the patch at the inside edge of the rear sticky strip, applying the glue and paint, and *then* removing the covering from the sticky material and placing the patch on the G6 butted back against the front end of the accessory shoe. Alternatively (and now more likely), I would not cut the patch at all, but would instead leave the protective material on the sticky strips on at the patch rear and front edges, and use only the sticky material at its side edges to hold the patch on the camera's top, letting the front edge extend over the front edge of the G6 slightly.<br /><br />The WindCutter's fitting problems are worth dealing with given its price and its advantages (if it can be fitted at all to your particular camera), and I will likely buy another one and try it again, fitting it as last described above.<br />--DR<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />--> SINCE WRITING THE ABOVE, I RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING EMAIL FROM WINDCUTTER:<br /><br />Hello David,<br /><br />We just noticed your review of this product posted on Amazon. We do appreciate you taking the time to write your thoughts.<br /><br />It has come to our attention that some people are purchasing this Stick-On WindCutter for cameras other than the ones listed in the description that it actually fits. The camera models listed are ones that this is made specifically to fit. We actually have MANY other models we make. There's also a \\""custom\\"" Stick-On ordering page at our website, TheWindCutter.com.<br /><br />You should never have to cut the Stick-On to fit. That's our job! The way it works is by adhering the border of \\""sticky\\"" around the entire microphone area. This helps to seal out the wind as much as possible. And, while nothing has been invented that will totally eliminate all the wind noise, the WindCutter used this way will help (in most cases) to reduce the noise.<br /><br />There are some cameras that are more difficult to fit a Stick-On to because of the placement of the microphone area. Sometimes knobs, flashes, hot-shoes, etc. don't allow an adequate amount of space around the mic to be able to fit the WindCutter properly. But with accurate measurements most of the time we can make something fit.<br /><br />I just thought I should explain. I really do appreciate your feedback.<br /><br />If you are interested in purchasing a Stick-On to fit your Panasonic G6 please let me know.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Rebekah<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",3/23/2014

I have since purchased the WindCutter stick-on noise reduction piece for this camcorder and used it for a month in Europe.  It worked very well. While standing on a bridge in Poland, the wind was quite excessive, and with the WindCutter in place, I was anxious to review the scene. The WindCutter cut out almost all of the wind noise without eliminating regular talking that I wanted to record.  I also happened to be in several churches where organ recitals were occurring. I got the chance to record several of the organ works and was very pleased with the results.  I recommend this product without hesitation.",6/27/2014

This is a low heat light and high wattage tungsten lamps will be a hazard.<br /><br />Minor issue: Some of the tabs inside the sockets needed to be lifted slightly to improve the contact wi the bulbs. Takes 2 seconds to do this. MAKE SURE YOU ARE UNPLUGGED WHEN YOU ADJUST IT!<br /><br />Summary: Great value. Good performance. Good packing and shipping.,11/24/2014

I've been a photographer for a long time and own far too much studio gear than I'd like to admit, but I don't have any constant lighting for video work.  I also have a zillion light stands, so the 'kits' that are all sold on here are great, but I have light stands and just wanted a head.  This is one of only a few heads available without a stand for a reasonable price.<br /><br />3 stars because it works, screw in light bulbs and it turns on.<br /><br />I deducted 2 and probably should more for the following reasons.  The castings around the light sockets are horrible and honestly, if you run anything other than CFL bulbs that operate at a low temp, they will most likely fall apart.  The head itself also is solid plastic for mounting to the light stand.  My experience is a 1/4 turn too far and this will get snapped.  I've repaired similar in the past with JB Weld but a little metal here wouldn't hurt.<br /><br />The softbox section works but dear god is it painful. No speedring means you have to assemble it ON the head, it's not difficult but you need to be very gentle.<br /><br />This is meant for VERY light duty, and honestly you're probably best leaving it fully assembled all the time because setup and break-down will most likely shorten the lifespan.",5/9/2015

It's designed to provide continuous light for video but works for stills if you shoot at larger apertures. Bulbs are not included so budget $25 to $40 for a four-pack of 45W or 60W CFLs.<br /><br />LIGHT HEAD: This unit is plastic save for electrical contacts, wires and screws. The back of the head has two power switches, allowing independent control of left and right banks, i.e., half or full power. The power cord is wired into the unit and not detachable. Holes for softbox rods and umbrella are built into the case.<br /><br />The light sockets are delicate but have a ceramic collar with metal insert. Sockets are set close so larger CFLs will not fit side by side. After some struggle--sockets cross-thread easily--I loaded the head with four [[ASIN:B00HPOKMCA Neewer 85 watt 5500 K CFLs]]. Neewer CFLs are smaller than most 85 watt CFLs, i.e., similar size and output to 45 or 60 watt CFLs. The fit was snug--base against base--but they worked and were extremely bright. My 105 watt StudioPro CFLs and [[ASIN:B00BISL11U KAEZI 85 Watt Studio CFL]] will not fit side by side. The safest bet is to use four 45W or 60W CFLs as most models will fit. Of course, you can mix larger and smaller CFLs or populate every other socket. I find two 85W CFLs ideal for use as a fill light.<br /><br />The light stand mount is plastic fantastic. It fits 5/8&#34; male light stand tips or smaller. Even fits on mic stands. Don't over torque or the thread insert (a metal nut) will pull out of the plastic. Loaded with CFLs and softbox this rig is heavy and should not be used on a flimsy stand. ItΓÇÖs front heavy on my Manfrotto 1051 BAC and needs a sandbag on the opposite leg for counterbalance.<br /><br />This head is light duty and appears to be the same as light heads sold under several brand names, e.g., [[ASIN:B00H7V9D5S NEEWER Four-Bulb Studio Light]] and [[ASIN:B0054K8HJW ePhoto Photography Video 4 CFL Light Head]]. They all say &#34;Super Lamp Holder SLH3&#34; on the back and obviously originate in the same Chinese factory.<br /><br />SOFTBOX: The LimoStudio 50cm x 70cm (20&#34;x28&#34;) softbox is made surprisingly well with heavy duty nylon, highly reflective interior, four steel ribs and a white nylon diffusion panel. It requires assembly but only takes a few minutes. First, stretch the rear opening around the light head. The elastic holds it in place. Place each of the four ribs in the mount holes on the light head. One by one, flex the rib and tuck it into a pocket on the edge of the softbox. Next, install the CFLs in the light head. Finally, attach the diffusion panel by pressing it onto the velcro on the outside of the softbox. That's it. It took five minutes my first time and grew faster with each session.<br /><br />I recommend installing the softbox ribs before screwing in the CFLs. Why? If you slip while flexing a steel rib and poke a bulb it will be bad for both you and the bulb.<br /><br />With the four 85W CFLs and white diffusion panel in place, the quality of light is wonderfully soft and even. The 20&#34; x 28&#34; softbox is compact and ideal for small studios and tight quarters. I mainly use it as a fill light with a six-CFL Linco Flora head as key.<br /><br />GOTCHAS: I tried to insert my Westcott umbrella in the umbrella hole to no avail. The spring loaded retaining clip at the end was too tight. I was not willing to muscle an umbrella through a hole with four large CFLs inches from my knuckles. Finally, due to the low price, most people buying this product are novice photographers. So step by step instructions or a a link to a PDF or how-to YouTube video should be included.<br /><br />FINAL BURB: Yes, it is cheaply made, needs a handle and a better umbrella mount hole, but it's the best deal for home studios this side of a Jackson. The bottom-line is this LimoStudio combo does what I want: illuminates my videos andphotos like a champ.",6/14/2015

Also, since there's no electronic communication to the camera, you have to set the camera to allow use with lenses that don't communicate, and the f-stop will be frozen to &#34;wide open&#34; at all times.  Still, for the price, it's a wonder that you can even fit your Canon lens to your Micro four-thirds body; in this case an Olympus EM-5 mkII.  So, I'm satisfied. After all, for me, it isn't far removed from my experience in manual photography only a decade or two in the past.<br /><br />There are adapters for around 400 bucks that allow for f-stop selection as well as EXIF data to be read by the camera, but that's a steep price for the priviledge; still, it can easily be justified if you have some &#34;way cool&#34; lenses from the past.",7/13/2015

Maybe the effect could be better if I stacked them?<br /><br />Still, the shipping was prompt. Hoya's filters always thread easily and I'm usually not let down by their build or quality. This filter, as Elly H said, gives your photo a nice soft look and removes some of the contrast. It's a bit of a novelty effect but for $15 it's pretty fun to play around with.",3/8/2014

I was worried because my stabilizer and camera all weigh around 30-40lbs and I didnt know if it would work. I ended up trying it and it still supported all my gear. The only downside is with the weight I have trouble adjusting the knobs on the arm for the spring tension. But I found from a tutorial on a similiar vest which was CAME, that you have to straighten the arm while the stabilizer is on it to easily adjust. Also the bottom adjustment to in which the contraption attaches to the vest itself sometimes sticks and can slide off. Always make sure you tighten the safety screw so it doesnt drop your camera. Other than that it worked great! Lots of compliments and, vest is very sturdy and comfortable. I hope you enjoy the video!",9/15/2014

Thank God.,"I bought this vest arm for my glidecam xr4000, because the vest arm that comes with the glide cam is way more expensive for doing the same thing. I took a risk at buying a third party stabalization vest. Thankfully it paid off great! The arm works wonderful with my glidecam. It's just to get accustomed to using it now. The two problems I have is that part which connects the glidecam with the vest doesn't fit snug (it's not a glidecam product so i shouldn't be surprised) but I solved that problem with simply cutting a pvc pipe and using that as an adapter. The other problem is that vest doesn't fit me as it should, and well I'm very skinny so i would have to put special modifications on the vest. but it works like a charm besides that. I look forward to seeing how this improves my shots in future jobs I have.",4/22/2014

The front design of the bag is easy to access for my canon lenses and speedlite. I was able to fit a 24-105mm/16-35mm/50mm/14mm fisheye and my speedlite into this compartment. The top part of the bag offers enough space for me to slot in my 5D MK II with attached lens when needed or simply just carring my camera body along with flash trigger/receivers. My vaio 15 inch notebook slots in nicely into the back.<br /><br />I traveled with this bag on our honeymoon to Europe and carried this bag daily through 3 different countries with all the equipment listed above along with a manfrotto tripod. I know we are all scared of thieves and pickpockets who steal from the bag, especially with zips that are easily accessible, so whenever I was walking in the streets I used the raincover and covered the bag.

In this case, however, I must say that after trying to use the camera for a few days, I ended up returning it.  The settings user interface is not very friendly, so it takes a bit of time to adjust it. Thus, my main problem was that the Auto settings and auto-focus adjusted very slow, and more often than not the pictures have the wrong white balance, they are blurry and out of focus. The 3x optical zoom is as described, but since the pictures do not come through very clear, the 3x optical zoom feels very much like a limitation.<br /><br />I owned a previous PowerShot version and it was one of the best point-and-shoot cameras I've had.

I had a couple of the old film Canon SureShots and loved them. Dropped one of those in icy stream, air dried it and it kept on working until I dropped it down a ravine and couldn't get to it.

The A2600 is a fine point and shoot that performs well and produces quality images. A step up from the A2500, it grows the back display LCD from 2.7&#34; to 3&#34; (diagonal) and adds face recognition capabilities. It appears to be solidly built, and is lightweight, weighing about 5oz. (S100 weighs 7oz). The A2600 has two shooting modes: Auto and Program; it lacks advanced modes like Manual and Aperture and Shutter Preferred modes found on more expensive compacts, which is OK for this level of camera. Overall, I'm pleased with the performance and photo quality, given the lower price point and knowing that it's not my primary, full-function camera.<br /><br />General Comments:<br />The 3&#34; diag. LCD screen (2-3/8&#34; x 1-3/4&#34;) is bright and sharp, easy to view in daylight conditions. Also, darker scenes are shown with enough detail (although very grainy) to compose a shot. The lens shows slight barrel distortion at wide, middle and 5x zoom levels, comparable to S100 lens. The zoom range is (35mm equiv.): 28mm - 140mm optical, up to 560mm equiv. with added digital zooming. The &#34;Auto&#34; mode decides what kind of picture you're taking (people? bright/dark scene? moving?) and adjusts exposure and focus quickly and appropriately. &#34;Program&#34; mode allows you to adjust exposure (through exposure compensation) and image quality (ASA, image contrast) a bit.<br /><br />The camera has a number of features found on more expensive cameras, as well as a few special effects modes. Check them out in the camera manual, found online at Canon's website on the A2600 product page, under &#34;Brochures and Manuals.&#34;<br /><br />Pros:<br />After reading the quick start instructions, basic operations were easy. The manual provides more details, particularly on Auto and Program modes. Color saturation looks good, comparable to the better S100. Image color lookedrealistic and accurate. I saw negligible to no chromatic aberrations, like R, G or B color bleeds at high-contrast edges. I like the flash and the fact that itΓÇÖs not a popup. It is sufficiently bright to provide good fill lighting in bright conditions, and gives nice, even lighting to low-light scenes without blowing them out.<br /><br />For Movies, the lens can be zoomed during recording. Zoom is smooth, but zoom motor is picked up by the microphone. Record button on back panel makes starting movie simple and quick. Record ΓÇ£stopΓÇ¥ can be done using the Shutter button, easier than using record button to stop.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The maximum equivalent ASA is 1600 (6400 in ΓÇ£low-lightΓÇ¥ mode ΓÇô grainy). Image gets &#34;noisy&#34; (looking grainy and non-crisp) in typical room-light conditions, where camera operates at ASA 800 or 1600. This is due to 16MP sensor - a 10-12MP sensor will typically produce better results. Thus, image quality is adequate but not fantastic in low-light. Slight grainy noise also seen at ASA 250, resulting in a slight loss of definition, fine details and edge crispness.<br /><br />Image processing after taking the picture is much slower than the S100. It takes 2 seconds after pressing the button for the camera to be ready for another shot (tested for 8MB (M1) and 16MB (L) settings.) The S100 takes less than 1 sec.<br /><br />Many of the niftier functions are buried in menus, making it less likely one will take the time to use these modes. You will probably not navigate to &#34;low-light&#34; mode to capture someone blowing out a candle in a dark room, but take your chances with Program or Auto modes. Fortunately, those easy-to-access modes produce fine results in most cases.<br /><br />For Movies, the lens zoom noise can be heard in recording (soft scratch-hiss during zoom.) Microphone is centered on the top of the camera, right above the lens. Zoom switch &#34;clicking&#34; may also be recorded.<br /><br />Summary:<br />This camera is a fine point-and-shoot and has enough &#34;auto&#34; features to allow you to concentrate on your composition. This is not the best camera to use for huge poster-size prints, but itΓÇÖs great for uses from e-mails to small photos, calendars, photo books, and even 8&#34; x 10&#34; pictures. Have fun with the camera - make your own test shots in various modes that you're likely to use, and find the quickest way to achieve the shot you want.",1/19/2014

I have a Canon D60 and usually keep an 18-200 lens mounted on it.  I previously used a Case Logic SLR case which had a hammock of sorts which helped suspend/hold the camera in place, which I found really annoying b/c it was a pain with the lens hood, or when I wanted to quickly take the camera in/out of the CL case.  Not anymore though!  This Thule case is very nicely designed, with a couple cushion pads included which allow me to move them around within the case so that *I* can choose how I'd like to cushion / position my camera while being stored, and allows for quick in/outs as well.  Straps are well designed, and the fabric and color of the case are great and not ostentatious.  The compartment is also pretty roomy (possibly too much for some people), which I like (but others might not).  I do wish the bag had a few more places to add accessories, like cleaning cloths or the like, but that's more of a nice-to-have for me than anything.

I am happy to report that it provided an excellent combination of protection and easy access while remaining wearable the entire time I was there.  I wore this bag strapped securely to the front or side of my torso on the rides without any problems whatsoever. On Soarin' Over California, for which there was no exception to removing your bag, it easily fit inside the storage net below my seat.

It fits.<br /><br />Likes:<br /><br />Two zippers to open the bag are on the body side, as it is worn on the body, convenient.<br /><br />Two fabric cushions with Velcro can be moved to change where the camera sits in the case, allowing for customization.<br /><br />Firm and thick cushioning provides better protection than neoprene cases I own.<br /><br />Can be worn in a few different positions.<br /><br />Rain cover is great.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br /><br />There is not a single pouch or separate area to stow an extra battery, lens cloth, and lens brush, three things I always have on my person while shooting.  As a workaround I positioned the foam cushions as high as possible to leave room at the bottom (under the camera's lens) and stuffed the stuff down there. I prefer a zip pouch either on the outside of the bag or in the inside of the lid, which allows access to those things while the camera is still inside the bag.<br /><br />This MEDIUM size (a designation determined by THULE) seems big. It seems too wide/deep but my camera only has one inch of space, so I don't see how it could be smaller. As an approximation, when worn on the front of the body it protrudes just like my former pregnant belly does.<br /><br />The strap is not comfortable enough. When wearing on the diagnonal with the case near the hip, the strap does not stay in place, it doesn't grip, and it's not cushioned enough either.<br /><br />Even when empty and I am shooting with the case on my person it feels weird and slides all over.<br /><br />Comparison to a Backpack:<br /><br />I thought I wanted a traditional camera case and to that end I ordered this plus purchased three others in the last 15 months but each had a flaw (size too small to fit camera, too thin fabric, not enough protection). So far the regular old backpack continues to be practical and successful so maybe I really don't need or want a traditional camera case after all?<br /><br />I find using a high quality day hiking backpack by North Face better for me. The backpack's straps are more cushioned and grip. I have the option of using one strap or two.

Generally, I like to carry the camera body with a lens attached, an extra battery plus the charger and an extra lens.

This has allowed Pixel to design a more unibody-like grip much akin to the 1D series, which they have been able to reinforce the bottom from the inside with a generous metal plate.<br /><br />The rubber liner looks right at home, aesthetically closely matching the ones on the camera body (it is slightly shinier than the camera's if you pay attention).  Grip rubber liner is made of slightly different rubber with it feeling a bit more slick as you run your fingers across it than that on the camera. The grip attaches firmly and I have not experienced any contacts slippage even when using somewhat heavier lenses (100-400L).<br /><br />The shutter button has been labeled as a hair trigger as it is a bit more sensitive that the 5DII shutter (less button press pressure needed) to go from focus to shoot. AF-ON, Exposure Lock, and AF select buttons have clicky responses unlike the camera, but work just fine.<br /><br />Battery info displays completely and accurately. Because of the improved body design, the battery trays are also redesigned and thus feel substantially stronger over the tiny pieces of plastic used in other grips.  Gold plated contacts are used throughout.<br /><br />Obviously, this grip is not made of magnesium alloy and not officially weather sealed, but the fit and finish seems top notch and at 1/4 the price of the official grip, a no brainer to buy unless if you shoot in the rain and mud all day long.",7/23/2013

What see me to it was its innovative design, the curved grip, the rubber wrapping around the whole grip, and the bottom feeding battery tray.<br /><br />That said, when I got my hands on it, I immediately recoiled at the discomfort in my hands, the grip is slightly larger than the OEM, but feels light years apart. The buttons are too clicky if you're used to the Canon OEM, and the wheel is very loose. Finally, there lacks the tension in the shutter button to prevent you from accidentally taking the picture as you try to focus.<br /><br />I want to give this product a 4 for innovation, but a 2 for execution. Which brings us to 3 stars.<br /><br />For a full review and head to head comparison with the Canon bg-e6 check out:<br /><br />[...]",10/29/2013

I took this to the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival the last few years, me on roller skates the whole time (!), and I'm skating through the crowds on pavement, snapping away with the camera attached to a nice neck strap, zooming in and out as required. ~6 weeks ago, snapped almost 1000 shots. I'm color blind, so I can't speak to the colors, but they look great to me. I have 4-5 other lenses, but this is the one I use 80+% of the time. Got it used in mint condition off Craig's List.    You can lock the lens so it doesn't creep outward, but it's held at the closest position. I have read that some of these have more creep than others, so YMMV.    I set my sights on this lens when researching accessories/etc. on the Pentax Forums. One guy, who had over 80 lenses for his Pentax DSLR's, said that this lens is the one that is most often attached to his camera body. I had to get one and am super glad I did.    I've read that \\""for maximum flexibility and minimum outlay, the DA18-250 is a great walk around. The Tamron 18-250 is almost as good, but the DA has SMC coating.\\"" The Pentax supports distortion correction, while the Tamron does not. I looked for and acquired the Pentax DA.    FYI, in my researching when shopping for lenses, one owner of this lens, after complaining to Pentax about the lens creep and experiencing much frustration, determined and posted this: \\""The solution I heard about a while ago is to put a large rubber band around the junction of the zoom ring with the lens body - this increases friction enough to hold the ring against creep.\\"" I haven't tried that. So far, the creep hasn't annoyed me all that much, but maybe someone can use this suggestion. Of course, YMMV.    I met the seller of the lens at a cafe with outside tables, some ~15 miles from my home. Here are some of the notes I recorded later that day:  - - -  In about 2 minutes I went through all the steps:    1. Took off the cap and hood and looked into the glass with a flashlight - it looked totally clean  2. Took off the rear cap and look with the light - clean again  3. Tried the focus and zoom rings - smooth  4. Shook it - no sound at all, no sense of anything loose whatsoever  5. Smelled it for tobacco smell - nothing  6. Zoom creep? Yep. I told him I figured it would have that, most of them do. He said something about it being a feature (WTF), and I said it's a failing of the design, but I expected it would have it (some don't, but I wasn't going to obsess over that).    I told him it was a deal and handed him the money, told him he could count it. He didn't say anything, didn't count the bills. They disappeared.    I had him sign the note of exchange I'd prepared. He added \\""as is,\\"" and the price (I had a space for the price already), $369.    We exchanged some pleasantries and went on our way.",11/17/2014

Now I am using it on my K5II and I'm loving it even more.

It is not a professional model that a scientist or astronomer would buy to do research. If you do not have the common sense or judgment to distinguish between these different applications then do not purchase this telescope.<br /><br /> What I like most about the Stargazer is the completeness of the kit; this package contains everything you would find in a &#34;real&#34; telescope kit, and is fully functional.  It comes with two lenses and is adaptable to be used either on the tripod or hand-held.  The included moon and planet charts alone are enough to excite a budding astronomer. Once assembled, it operates and functions just like it's much more costly big brothers.  A child who is given this can, with some instruction and competent supervision, have many hours of fun and solve some of the mysteries of space.<br /><br />The downside of this product is that it is almost completely plastic, and will not survive a lot of rough treatment.  In particular, your young scientist will need to be shown the need for a delicate touch when viewing and making adjustments. And, this is no different from owning a $10,000 rig- the same cautions apply; if you strip the adjustments, it won't hold the image, and if you bump it with your eye you will lose what you are looking for. This is a functional toy telescope at a very attractive price.

Still a great camcorder for a 2009 Model!,"This camcorder is great for everyday use as for average users as well as semi-professionals. I'd say that Sony Handycams are the best consumer level camcorders with cutting edge technology and rich vibrant HD video quality. This Sony has the richest color gamut I've ever seen in a consumer level camcorder. The fact that this camcorder records to a tapeless file based system gives high quality HD video and the footage looks just like the video you'd find on a professional TV broadcast. I'm a semi-professional/borderline professional self-employed videographer and I film primarily weddings, receptions and anniversaries. This is a great camcorder for a semi pro on a budget. When I take this camcorder to events to film, people don't seem to take me seriously, but once i play back the footage I recorded on this unit, they are all stunned in amazement. If I ever showed someone work from previous events, many complement me on such clear video quality. When I show them the camcorder I filmed it on, they can't believe it! The Sony HDR-XR200 shows that a camcorder can be small yet still produce stunning HD video. Shopping for camcorders, I would not go any lower than this model. The camcorder has a large hard disk drive at 120GB giving you up to 14 hours of recording in the fullest quality and as high as up to 50 hours of recording in the lowest quality mode.<br /><br />What I disliked about the camcorder is that the video quality is very grainy in low light settings. If you plan on shooting events with dim lighting, such as a candle-lit dinner or reception, be prepared to get an external video light for this camcorder. Also, although the XR200V has a great quality image sensor for full HD 1080 video recording, the photo quality in the camera function are rather of inferior quality. It has a 4MP camera, but photo quality is pretty bad. I've saw better photos on a 1.3MP Motorola RAZR V3 in 2004! But then again, is there any consumer video camera that DOES take decent quality photos? I think not. So, not to belittle the XR200, but still I'd say to always to buy a imaging unit for its main intended purpose. Use an HD camcorder for crisp HD video but not photos. And use professional DSLR for high quality photos and not for video. When you use one for the other, chances are that you will be disappointed.<br /><br />Other than that, I think this is an awesome camcorder!<br /><br />I'd recommend this unit to amateurs and prosumers alike. I consider myself a prosumer to borderline professional and with an external video light and the right video editing software, you can make some pretty awesome videos with this camcorder.hotos?

Fits great, reads in the camera and comes with a coveted cover which is a nice extra.  I have found that aftermarket batteries don't hold a charge as long and burn out in a year or 2 while the canon batterie that came with my 7D, which I depend on, has held up well for many years of hard use.  Aftermarket batteries are low cost, great for around town. Tip, They can be matched with canon ones in the extra grip which I always keep in my bag because the grip will also accept 6 AA batteries that you can get readily just about any place in the world in a pinch I have even taken the AAs out of my flash and recorder in order to keep shooting.<br /><br />I did like the E mail that this company sent me that said: &#34;If you have any issues please let us know.

I was in the market for a backup battery to have for events. Over the course of two years I have been able to compare this battery to my Canon ones as far as how well it holds up throughout the day.<br /><br />First off: I will say that if I have this battery in my camera I know that the charge will not last as long during an event as one of my Canon batteries. Usually I do not start with this battery in my camera to avoid not having a charge at one of the more important moments at a wedding. However, on the occasions that I have started with it, I have noticed that I am about mid to low on battery by the time the reception starts (on average about 5 hours of shooting at this point). I recently photographed a wedding in Seattle and it was about 50 degrees outside, and just from the getting ready shots (approximately 200-300 in and mostly indoors) I noticed the battery display was already on one bar. I know batteries tend to run out faster in the cold, however, I was able to compare the Canon one to this after I switched it out for the remainder of the event, and can say the cold weather affected this battery much more than my canon one.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this battery as an absolute backup battery to have in case of emergencies, but I would not recommend relying solely on this battery if you are an event photographer or shoot for long periods at a time. If you plan to use this battery for non-professional use you should definitely be fine; you will probably just have to charge it after each use.",7/27/2014

I also liked the fact that these units came with the yellow battery terminal protector plate. The only suggestion I would have is to have part of the bottom of the battery colored BLUE (instead of uniformly black) so that the the little hole in the cover plate can be used to indicate whether the battery is charged or not (like the original Canon chattery).

Pretty handy when you're on the road. Some reviewers have commented that the SterlingTEK batteries do not last as long as the original Canon batteries, but I have not personally seen any appreciable difference. I am an enthusiast, not a professional photographer, so I do not use my cameras as strenuously as the pros do. Still, I have shot all day and taken hundreds of pictures without running out of power.

However, this one was mostly a flop.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Accessible pocket on pad (handy for memory cards).<br />- Strap clamps make strap more secure/reliable.<br />- Mounting screw has open threads on its back so you don't have to dismount to use a tripod.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Strap clamps obstruct free flowing camera motions from hip to eye.<br />- Metal carabiner style hook on metal mount is LOUD.<br />- Description says mounting plate has rubber pad to prevent scratching your camera.  There is no rubber pad.  The METAL mountain plate will rub directly on your camera body.<br /><br />When I bought this strap, it was listed at $19.99.  The strap costs $10.00 at the moment, which is much more reflective of its quality.  Since it will likely scratch up my camera, and possibly make distracting noise at events (think wedding ceremonies), I decided to return it immediately.",2/26/2014

It's amazing that it works. I am very happy with my purchase. I have used this camcorder a couple of times this month and all the features are working fine. I have to shop for a Lithium button battery CR 1616, so I can keep the time and date in the camcorder. The battery was suppose to be included in the box, though it wasn't. Everything else was in the box and wrapped as new from the manufacture. Tape camcorders are the best for capturing things that you want to see over and over in excellent quality, and you know where they are located on the tape as well as duplicating them onto VHS. [I will never purchase the new camcorders that are digital on a hard drive because the image quality is not so good, I will give you an example here: Say that you are filming a Volkswagon car that is parked right next to an 18 wheeler semi truck in a parking lot, well when you playback that video you will see that the Volkswagon car and the 18 wheeler semi truck are shown as the same size, what I mean is that the 18 wheeler semi truck shrinks down to the same size as the Volkswagon car. Yes, and it's true with all other objects, including people, even if you transfer that onto tape it's the same false image.]  That is why I am willing to pay whatever the price is for a brand new tape camcorder, because a tape camcorder during playback shows everything normal, how you really see it. Manufactures really need to start making tape camcorders again. Thank you.",7/13/2015

So when I saw this pen offered on amazon I couldn't resist. Normally I'm hesitant to spend $40 on anything, but the pen appeared to be extremely high end, and I just had to have it! The design of the pen is really cute and functional, and easy to hide in a pocket if necessary. You can even just leave it right on the desk considering it looks just like a real pen.  It's very easy to use, and then easy to plug into your computer and upload the video when you are done. I have tried similar products and have not been to thrilled with the results. This pen, however, works great and makes you feel like your a real life undercover spy when using it -which is always a big plus in my book!

Fun gadget... when it works,"UPDATE 11/20/14:<br />Sherlock Hones informed me that they have updated the product description based on feedback provided through this review, including the expected recording times. I was asked to update the review, but without having tested the new pen, I cannot do so. I will respond to them later to see if a test unit can be sent. It's good to know that they continue working on improving the pen. As one comment noted, the description states that video now records at 720p, which I have not yet been able to verify.<br /><br />UPDATE 8/26/14 (Rating: 2/5):<br />I continued having issues getting consistently long recordings. Customer service sent me multiple pens to test, but all initially recorded fine for up to 30 mins, but subsequent recordings were erratically short (few seconds), or the pen ceased to function at all. Taking pictures always worked, however. It's disappointing that the pen would not reliably function, but I very much have to give Sherlock Hones high marks for their excellent customer service. In the end, I do not know why the pens stopped working, and cannot, unfortunately, recommend this product. Until it can be used to reliably record videos, I had to downgrade my rating from 4/5 to 2/5. Sherlock Hones, I really thank you for your excellent customer service, and hope that the reliability issues can be worked out soon. Until then, I cannot give a higher rating at this time.<br /><br />UPDATE 7/1/14 (Rating: 4/5):<br />I have to commend the customer service by Sherlock Hones. Not only were email inquiries answered within a day since my original review went up, I was unexpectedly sent a free gift and a replacement for my (probably) defective unit. I was happy to see that the replacement worked much better, and was amazed how much spy technology has progressed. As one of my co-workers stated upon seeing the sample video I shot: \\""Wow, it's in COLOR? I was expecting it to be black and white. Video is pretty good for such a small camera.\\""<br /><br />Review will be split into 5 sections: PROS, CONS, USAGE/ TIPS, TESTS, SUMMARY.<br /><br />PROS<br />- Looks and works like a regular pen<br />- Accepts up to 16GB microSD card (as expected, test with 64GB did not work)<br />- 2GB microSD card is included, though a higher-capacity would have been nice for the pen's retail price<br />- Video quality is decent. Can read text. Records in 480p<br />- Video is in color (files: .AVI format)<br />- Video file size is pretty small<br />- Battery life is good (up to 1.5 hours, according to manufacturer)<br />- Mini-USB (not Micro-USB) cable is included<br />- Carry pouch is included<br />- Instruction guide decently written, though some areas need improvement (vendor was notified with suggestions)<br />- Customer service was very friendly and had fast responses<br /><br />CONS<br />- Video, though decent in resolution, has blue, horizontal bands interlaced throughout<br />- Video does not record audio. Sherlock Hones point to US wiretapping laws for having to disable that functionality<br />- Despite audio recording being disabled, the resulting video contains buzzing audio<br />- Video file size could probably be smaller if buzzing sound (or any audio) is stripped<br />- Video recording length was inconsistent. Sherlock Hones claims this is dependent on the quality and batch of the microSD card. They recommend Kingston brand. From my professional photography experience, I recommend SanDisk/Kingston<br />- Picture quality is decent, but the interlacing makes it look terrible, particularly when trying to read smaller text (see photos uploaded to Amazon)<br />- Date/Time has to be manually updated each time by editing the TIME.TXT file on the pen<br />- Requires use of mini-USB (not microUSB) cable. Some pens have the USB connector built into the pen<br />- Cannot record while charging the pen<br />- Instructions do not show how to reset the pen. It simply points out the reset hole's location<br />- Some questions to customer service had to be repeated a couple times to get an answer. But generally, service was excellent<br />- Firmware updates via website should be provided to update pen with bug fixes<br />- Clip should be rotatable to allow camera to be pointed in various angles while used horizontally<br /><br />USAGE/ TIPS<br />Note: according to Sherlock Hones, the timing can be off by a few seconds.<br />- To use a new microSD card, format it on your Windows computer as \\""FAT\\"" file system, with Allocation size set to \\""Default\\""<br />- Turn on pen by holding button for 2 seconds. It'll turn solid green. This puts the pen into \\""Ready\\"" mode.<br />- Click button once, and a picture gets taken (LED turns off for a few secs, then returns to solid green.)<br />- Hold the button for 2 secs (manual says 3 secs), and green LED will blink 3 times, then off. It'll blink green every few secs to let you know that it's recording a video now. If you hold the button long enough to see the RED LED, that means it's powering off.<br />- Recording is stopped by clicking the button once. LED returns to solid green.<br />- If LED stops blinking (it's completely off) while recording, the pen has powered itself off.<br />- Hold the button for 3+ secs until you see the RED LED. It'll blink 6 times, then the pen is powered off.<br />- Connect the pen to your computer via the included Mini-USB cable to access your files. In my original review, there were \\""PHOTO, VIDEO, and RECORD\\"" folders. In the replacement, there were \\""PHOTO and VIDEO\\"" folders. Deleting these folders will have the pen recreate them on next use<br />- With pen connected to computer, it'll charge the battery. You may also edit the TIME.TXT file in the appropriate format to set the date and time. Note: this needs to be updated every time you want to use the pen.<br />- YouTube videos should be made available on how to use this pen. Sherlock Hones stated that one is in the work<br /><br />TESTS<br />These tests were performed with the 2GB card that was included by Sherlock Hones. I'll update review once I have a chance to test with my 16GB.<br /><br />- Photos: .JPG of about 250KB each. See uploaded customer images for indoor & outdoor samples<br /><br />- Videos<br />a. Test 1: 30:00 mins at 1.6GB, and continued for 2:42 mins at 136MB. Recording stopped after. Battery life was still good, and 60MB was still free on the card. Based on my knowledge of photographic devices, the videos are probably cut off at 30 mins so that the pen would not be classified (and taxed) as a camcorder.<br /><br />b. Test 2: 20:04 mins at 839MB, and continued for 7:22 at 306MB. Recording stopped after. There was still plenty of battery life and space left.<br /><br />c. Test 3: 15:02 mins at 667MB, and continued for 4:04 at 177MB. Recording stopped after. There was still plenty of battery life and space left.<br /><br />d. Test 4 (7/2/2014): 30:05 mins at 604MB on another 2GB microSD card. Recording stopped after. There was still plenty of battery life and space left. Video had colored garbage as if it was corrupted. I'll test again after the July 4 vacation.<br /><br />I was perplexed by why the recording stopped before space or battery life ran out. The recording length varied. Upon contacting Sherlock Hones, they stated that for the last 2 years, their own pen recorded flawlessly for up to 1.5 hours. They cited microSD card quality/manufacturer on the variance. I'll test with a 16GB SanDisk or Kingston card one of these days and update review. Sherlock Hones recommends taking the pen to a local electronics store and test out various microSD cards from different manufacturers until you find one that works well.<br /><br />SUMMARY<br />The videos the pen produced were quite amazing despite the blue banding and buzzing audio. Nobody knew that I was recording in the office while walking with the pen around. Even having the pen in my shirt pocket raised no suspicion, though my manager did raise an eyebrow of why I was wearing one and looking like a total geek. The picture quality is not quite clear (when it comes to capturing smaller text), but can be useful in snapping photos in a pinch.<br /><br />If only the recording length was consistent (where it does not stop recording despite having plenty of battery life or microSD card storage left), I would have rated this pen with 5 stars (out of 5). On its own, I would rate the pen 3 stars, but the excellent customer service bumps my overall rating to 4 stars.<br /><br />-----<br />EDIT 6/24/14 (Rating: 2/5):<br />Sherlock Hones reached out to me about my experience and indicated that a replacement will be sent. I have temporarily upgraded my review from 1 star to 2 because they have re-affirmed my initial feeling: they provide good customer service.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW (Rating: 1/5):<br />Among all the pens I looked at, I felt that Sherlock Hones appeared to provide the best customer service based on their responses to other reviews. However, I was wrong. A question I posted to their website a week ago has been left unanswered. With that said, the product was ordered through Amazon, and it arrived a bit scuffed, and finger prints were visible at the base of the pen (where the on/off button is.) This concerned me a bit, but nonetheless, after inserting the memory card and charging the pen for a few hours, I put it to test:<br /><br />Hold 2 secs to turn on. Done. A solid, green light indicates \\""Ready mode\\"". Click on/off button once to take picture. Done. This part has worked consistently. Picture quality: horrible. I could not read any text of the paper I took a photo of.<br /><br />Next was the all-important video test. Hold for 3 secs, and the light should blink a few times, then slowly blink every few secs to indicate that it's recording. This worked 2 out of the 15+ tries. The few times it did record, the files were no more than 8 mb in size, or just a few secs of recording. All the other video files were 0 bytes in size. Video quality: acceptable, but not as expected. Note: It was quite tricky trying to get the video recording to work. After the green LED blinks 3x, it would turn red. I assume that red meant that it was powering off. So, holding for an actual 3 secs would actually turn off the pen. The few times I did get the pen to work, I let go at around the 2nd blink, which is about a 1-2 sec hold. Again, I could not reliably get the video function to work.<br /><br />Hold for 6 secs to turn off. I found that holding just 3 or 4 secs until the red light turned on would be sufficient.<br /><br />I thought that perhaps the pen was faulty. I formatted the memory card and tested. Same results. I then proceeded to push a paper clip through the Reset hole. I expected to feel some sort of give -- generally, when you push a reset button on an electronic device, you can feel a slight resistance, followed by it giving in or clicking. Neither was heard or felt, leading me to believe that the reset button perhaps was broken. I may have received a previously-returned unit.<br /><br />I decided to return the product.<br /><br />The product came in a black, soft pouch, including a Mini USB-type (not Micro USB) cable, and a guide. The guide was easy to follow, but the timings referenced in it did not match my experience (ie. it asks to hold for 6 secs to turn off the pen, when in fact I only had to hold for 4 secs.) The pouch itself came in a zip-lock type bag. For those thinking about recording with the pen laid down horizontally, keep in mind that you'd have to support the clip to ensure the camera points straight ahead instead of down onto the desk.t 1: 30:00 mins at 1.6GB, and continued for 2:42 mins at 136MB. Recording stopped after. Battery life was still good, and 60MB was still free on the card. Based on my knowledge of photographic devices, the videos are probably cut off at 30 mins so that the pen would not be classified (and taxed) as a camcorder.    b.

Again, I could not reliably get the video function to work.    Hold for 6 secs to turn off. I found that holding just 3 or 4 secs until the red light turned on would be sufficient.    I thought that perhaps the pen was faulty. I formatted the memory card and tested. Same results. I then proceeded to push a paper clip through the Reset hole. I expected to feel some sort of give -- generally, when you push a reset button on an electronic device, you can feel a slight resistance, followed by it giving in or clicking. Neither was heard or felt, leading me to believe that the reset button perhaps was broken. I may have received a previously-returned unit.    I decided to return the product.    The product came in a black, soft pouch, including a Mini USB-type (not Micro USB) cable, and a guide. The guide was easy to follow, but the timings referenced in it did not match my experience (ie. it asks to hold for 6 secs to turn off the pen, when in fact I only had to hold for 4 secs.) The pouch itself came in a zip-lock type bag. For those thinking about recording with the pen laid down horizontally, keep in mind that you'd have to support the clip to ensure the camera points straight ahead instead of down onto the desk.",6/24/2014

Great fun for kids and adults,Received my spy pen and was immediately impressed with it's quality look and feel. You would never suspect it was a video camera as well as able to snap photo's too. Directions were straight  forward not your usual confusing obvious translated directions. The package came with everything needed to begin your amateur sleuthing. The attractive bag that holds the pen is a good idea as it will help keep It out of your pen holder where it would blend in with all other pens. After my first trial video the image resolution was impressive. I use the VLC player which worked perfect. Besides spy and detective fans like myself this pen would be a great gift for your younger teenager. The lifetime warranty is reassuring and speaks to a well made product. Very much looking forward to much more covert experimenting with this camera pen.,5/15/2014

Also, the plastic knob on the topmost tightening screw has loosened.  It just spins on the screw.  Maybe I overtightened it, but it's a mistake that I imagine is easy to make.

I really like it and would LOVE it if not for the aforementioned issue.<br /><br />It's VERY long and not easy to transport but that's a small price for such a tall and sturdy stand, especially considering that some people actually carry C-stands into the field.<br /><br />On that note, the two problems that I mentioned (lacking stability when fully extended and plastic tighthening knob failure) has me seriously considering C-stands from here on, but this was my first light stand and I think it is a pretty good one, despite the problems I've had. I have heard of MUCH worse construction and quality.",8/24/2015

Really it's worth 3.5 stars, but of course that's not an option. The main issues with it are that it's a bit of a pain overall - you have to take off the top flap entirely in order to comfortably/properly take a picture, and I foresee that eventually getting dropped/left behind/lost as I keep having to remove it and set it aside. Additionally, the bottom part of the case screws into the base of the camera, which means that any time you need to get the memory card out you have to unscrew that piece to remove it, which is more than a little bit of a pain.",8/7/2014

It is comparable to the quality of OEM cases on late model cameras... which are often left out to cut costs on camera kits.  The fit is good.  It was a bit tight trying to line up the screw, but once it was in the appearance and fit were great.<br /><br />To put the strap on remove the plastic buckle and slide from the strap -- they were on in reversed sequence on my straps.  Install the buckle then the slide.  Pull a loop of the fabric strap through the brass loop on the case. Fold to the inside, so the ends will not be flipped out on the finished side.  Likewise make sure the buckle faces out, the plastic center should be visible from the inside only.  Make the length according to how you want the camera to hang from your neck.  Slip the slide all the way down to the brass loop. Run the doubled strap through the buckle until 1/2 to 3/4 inch extends above the buckle.  That's it.",4/6/2014

The result is a rustic but beautiful pattern of light gray to deep black peppered with splashes of white. Mine is a significantly darker than the product photo and works great as a defocused background for portraits and music videos. However, the patterns are strong and busy when in focus. Although not advertised as &quot;reversible,&quot; it looks great reversed, i.e., a mellow and less visually demanding gray tie-dye.<br /><br />I detected a funky odor similar to vinegar and evaporated milk but a couple days on a clothesline aired it out. The fabric, as expected, is lightweight but decent quality cotton. By definition Muslin is lightweight cotton cloth and, yep, it's thin so a backing layer is necessary if used against bright light. It shipped with fold lines but they were easily nixed with a fabric steamer.<br /><br />I own a half dozen backdrops and this one is by far my favorite.

The box that it was in was securely stuck to the bottom of the shipping box. So, it wouldn't shuffle during transport.  It also had paper padding placed on top for add protection.

I have one of these pointed outside behind a window.  Here are my observations:<br /><br />1. The video motion support is pretty basic and suitable for indoor use only.  If you point the camera out a window, you will get all sorts of false triggers from, for example, trees blowing in the wind.  You'll be better off mounting a PIR sensor outside and running wires to the camera.  Fortunately, the camera has I/O capability that makes it a snap to connect to an external PIR sensor, alarm system, spotlight, and so on.<br />2. The event processing (motion and whatnot) is tricky to set up if you're used to simpler cameras. If you read the documentation and are careful, you'll find it's very flexible.<br />3. The day/night mode and IR LED are separately configurable, so if you do have it behind a window, you can for example disable the IR LED and mount an external illuminator switched by the output terminals on the camera while having the camera in night mode.  Cool!<br />4. The maximum frame rate at 1080p is 15fps, which is adequate for catching faces.  At 720p it does 30fps.<br />5. You can switch the aspect ratio to 4:3 and get 25fps at 1440x1080, which gives quite fluid motion.<br />6. For indoor use, the single high-power IR LED and sensitivity combine to give far better night vision than the quad LEDs on the DCS-942L.  It's also a lot more subtle--less likely to get noticed by a thief.  I tested the night vision indoors in pitch black and found it adequate for facial recognition from 25 feet away.<br /><br />Overall it's a pretty decent camera.  The firmware has improved drastically since many of these reviews were written but still has a few quirks:<br /><br />1. I find that, when the camera is set to e-mail a series of snapshots and is simultaneously set to record continuously, the first few snapshots are from the previous triggerand so can be several hours old.  My guess is that the CPU burden of continuous recording and video motion detection maxes out the CPU in the camera and the snapshots don't happen in time.  I've notified D-Link about the issue and will  update this review if the issue gets fixed by D-Link.<br />2. The web interface requires Internet Explorer and an ActiveX control to configure video motion regions.  If you are not using video motion, the interface is 100% functional with other browsers.<br />3. Macs have issues with streaming Quicktime through routers with mapped ports.  PCs can view Quicktime just fine from outside a router.  Macs can stream motion JPEG without audio or can access the Quicktime streams if on the same LAN.<br /><br />NOTE: This is NOT a MyDLink camera.  It is designed to be accessed directly through its own internal web server, so you will need to map ports on your router.",1/4/2014

I received it only to find out that unlike the other three D-Link cameras this one is not supported in OSX or (even more amazingly) D-Link's own iOS app.  There are likely workarounds for each, for instance D-Link's support forums mention third party apps that will do what theirs won't (support their own camera!), but if you use either you should know that before you buy one.",4/25/2014

The Canon PowerShot SX520 HS bundle is a tremendous value. If you are like me and rely on your smartphone to take pictures you will find only a slight increase in picture quality. That is, as long as you have a flagship smartphone like a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 or LG G4 or iPhone 6 Plus. But the moment you zoom even a little, the Canon starts to separate itself. My daughter graduated a few months ago and my entire family took pictures with their smartphones. We were seated far enough away that the everyone's best shots were grainy and unimpressive. I missed the opportunity to record that moment in photos and will never get a second chance.  So I bought this starter camera. I have added some of photos I've taken with the camera, all with some degree of zoom. The last photos of the pine tree and needles give you as an idea of how powerful the zoom is. I took both photos standing in the same spot, one without zoom, the other at full zoom. I recommend you watch YouTube videos to learn what the camera can do. Here is a video that helped me but there are others: Understanding Canon Powershot HS cameras: Part 1 ΓÇª: https://youtu.be/rYpTaFoE6Fg<br /><br />The Canon PowerShot SX520 HS bundle is the perfect starter camera to graduate you from smartphone camera and prepare you for more expensive SLR cameras.

This grip looks great on the camera, feels great, and is super light weight. Durability is always a question when it comes to organic pieces but I take care of my equipment so I don't really see an issue. I also attached a Fusion Photo Gear-Fusion Plate to the bottom so I can use my arca swiss tripod head and attach the camera to a strap without removing the plate. It's a great combination and doesn't add much weight at all. The grip adds a very nice retro look to an already retro camera and really looks better and cost less than the OEM attachment.

What do I like about it? The perfect and safe fit of the grip base plate on the camera. That I can finally leave the Novoflex MC 1/4 Spare Coupling Plate on the base of the camera/wood grip while changing sd card or battery.<br />What do I dislike: Base of grip and cylindrical handle are made of different wood quality. I would have liked a bit more creative design! The cylindrical handle should be a little bit larger to hold it safely - now I feel it is rather disproportional to the size of the base - and should have some slight grooves for the fingers. The side of the cylindrical handle facing the camera body could have been adapted a little bit to the form of the body, this solution would be more elegant.<br />Price is OK, a little bit on the expensive side, especially since the wood has neither been polished with carnouba wax nor been varnished.",11/6/2014

I just needed a little extra grip, access to the battery/SC door and a bonus would have been if the tripod mount lined up with the lens.  This handmade, JB Design grip checks all the boxes and then some.  Perhaps the best aspect of the grip is just how lightweight it is...about half the listed weight of the OEM Fuji one.  I'm really looking forward to it 'breaking in' as I continue to use it...the natural oils from my hand further customizing the feel of the grip over time.  Also JB himself is responsive and a delight to deal with if you ever have any questions.  I'm considering picking up a FujiFilm X-T1 too and he told me he's designed a grip for that...tempting (tho admittedly, the battery grip on the Fuji is probably the way I'd go for that one for the extra capacity).

I am happy with the lenses. Very crisp. Clean. And it comes with a little bag too, so it's really easy to store.<br /><br />I guess if you're willing to pay 50 dollars to get a series of crappy stuff, then this should be good for you. The bag feels kind of gross in your hands. You can tell how cheap it is. What IS nice about it, though, is the side pockets. However, padding is questionable.<br /><br />The cleaning kit was fine. It did it's job. The screen protecter sucks....really horrible, actually. You have to physically cut out the size you want (which isn't the main reason of my complaint). When you do, you see the screen protector is more of the \\""dull\\"" screen protector. Also, you can't put it on the screen without getting your finger prints on the other side. It's so floppy, you can't just gently hold it onto the sides. *Sigh* What a waste.<br /><br />Finally, the tripod. Man, I wish that tripod was good. I was so looking forward to it. When I took it out of the bag, the first thing I saw was the level indicator. It looks like it was literally just glued on. You could still see the glue hardened on the level...so it's not even a clear enough to see very ell. The legs are not very stable. It's very light - but that goes into the instability. Really, what a piece of crap.<br /><br />I guess that's all I can really say about that.<br />Personally, I think you shouldn't invest in this. If you want a filter - buy it separately. If you want batteries - buy it separately. You'll probably get better quality stuff for the same price instead of investing in half crap - half good things.<br /><br />Just a thought.<br /><br />I hope this helps.<br />Best,<br />Frequent Amazon Shopper & Film nut.<br /><br />P.S. I just realized that the tripod doesn't actually become level. No, it's not just me. I've used my friend's tripod, and there's no issue with that. There'sliterally nothing I can do about magically making one leg equal to the other two (unless I physically make it shorter). I mean...why make one leg longer than the two others? That really does not make sense. Make it equal lengths, then sell it. Thank you. One final thing. The pan on it is horrible. It doesn't matter how loose you make it, it will not move without sudden, dysfunctional motions. Also, a random nut just fell off the tripod - no idea what piece that belongs too, but clearly it's already falling apart. I just got this today, and all I've done is set it up, check the level mechanic, check the pan, etc. Piece of junk. Damn.<br />Do not buy this. It's absolute garbage.<br />:)",2/19/2014

For example, for 10.5\\"" clamp lights, I cut out a really long piece, wrap it around the reflector, clothes pinned it, and used it to control the light.<br /><br />I also use this on my CN-160 LED light. The foil is some what durable (wish it was a couple of millimeters thicker), so I just use the same piece, fold it up a few times until it's smaller, and wrap it around the CN-160.<br /><br />I bought the 24\\"" instead of the 12\\"" because I knew I was going to use them on clamp lights. Even with the foil wrapped around the socket portion of the clamp light, I find I still have a lot of snoot/barndoor to manipulate (sometimes too much). I suggest [[ASIN:B005NEJ13A Rosco Photofoil Matte Black Cinefoil, 12 inch x 10 feet Roll]] if you are only using this foil for flashes.<br /><br />You will form holes if you keep folding/unfolding a piece of foil. The holes will form at the creases you make, but they are small. To avoid any frayed ends, I went ahead and used duct tape (or gaffers) to reinforce the edges by folding the tape over the edges. This way, there's no chance of a frayed end turning into a massive tear.<br /><br />Some other uses for this foil: covering up small windows, substituting for a flag, and wrapping it around your lens for a quick lens shade.<br /><br />It's a nifty product, comes in handy on shoots, and I highly recommend it!",11/6/2013

Outdoor - Silver",Camera,1,3,4,N,Y,Good camera but bad software and a joke for a company. Light changes cause problems.,"Okay.  I would like to start off by saying that, this is good camera hardware wise.  If you are a geek and have good technical troubleshooting skills, you might be able to get these things to work okay.  The main problem with these cameras is the software that runs them and the company that supports them (ROTFL! more like DOES NOT SUPPORT THEM!)<br /><br />My experience.<br />I bought these cameras to monitor the front door of my grandparent's house.  My grandfather has dementia and sometimes forgets that the house he is in is his house and goes outside to find his house.  I needed a way to monitor his front door be alerted when he goes outside, so I can get someone over to his house to make sure he does not wander off (I live 150 miles away).  I installed a cheap wireless IP cam (Esky H6800 $65) on my house last year to monitor it while I was away on vacation and it works pretty good and thought this might be a solution to the situation with my grandfather as well. Even though I got the Esky H6800 to work, it did take some doing and the Esky company is even more of a joke then Foscam, so I wanted to go with a better quality product and company for my grandparent's house.<br /><br />Foscam seem to be popular here on amazon, so I felt that they would be a safe bet.  I paid $90 for the two FI8903W cameras I bought ($25 more then the Esky H6800).  Honestly, from the looks of the two cameras, I cannot tell the FI8903W apart from the Esky H6800.  It would not surprise me to find that they are produced by the same Chinese company and just labeled by whoever sales them.<br /><br />Installation was about the same as the Esky H6800, but the mounting bracket on the H6800 is way better then the one on the FI8904W, which are very hard to adjust with any degree of precision.<br /><br />There are two ways to configure these cameras; through a web interface or through the included software (Foscam IP Camera Client version 1.2.9.).  I will deal with the web interface first.<br /><br />THE SOFTWARE:<br />  THE WEB INTERFACE<br />The web interface is almost identical to the interface of the Esky H6800 in both looks and functions, except for the fact that the web interface of the Esky H6800 is far more advanced with way more configuration option, especially when it comes to motion detection alert option.  The FI8903W only gives you the option to turn on the motion detection and receive alerts, but not how often or how many pictures to take on each trigger.  The Esky H6800 interface gives you the option of setting the time delay between alerts and how many pictures to take on each trigger.  There are many options on the FI8904W interface that are no clearly defined as to what they do and they are not covered in the user manual or anywhere online on the Foscam website.<br /><br />  THE INCLUDED MONITORING SOFTWARE<br />The included monitoring software is a total joke.  First off, version 1.2.9 does not even work to begin with.  The software has a glitch that prevents you from adding a camera to monitor.  Every time you try to add a camera you get and error that states, \\""This Device Already Exist\\"". I have found many other people that have this same problem with this version.  I also seen the idiot Foscam support reps tell these people that they have to use the \\""Run as Administrator\\"" function install the software so it will work correctly.  When the people have written back stating that have installed the program as administrator and are still getting the same error, the focam customer support reps just ignore the customer and keep repeating that the program needs to be installed as administrator.  I tried installing the software on three different Windows based computers under the administrator account the problem persist.  What's more the program file itself is an MSI type installation file and does not offer the context menu option of \\""Run as Administrator\\"", like an EXE installation file does.  So the CS reps are telling people to do something that cannot be done.  One rep was so dumb as to suggest that program had to be installed on a non-system drive to work.  Unbelievable! This is my second run in with Foscam's CS reps and on both occasions I have found them to be complete idiots and condescending to the customer.  I have yet to have single problem solved by them.  I have had to find the solution myself.  The solution to the software problem in this case was simple; I just found an older more stable version of the Foscam IP Camera Client software.  Wow!  That was so hard.  Makes you wonder why none of the condescending dumbbells over at Foscam did not think of it!  Or better yet, how about offering their own software for download on their own site!!!!!  No!  I had to look all over the Internet to find it somewhere else.  What a joke!<br /><br />As far as the software goes, (once you get it to work) it is poorly design and not very user friendly.  Most programs have a help function that explains what different functions do.  Not this software.  There are no instructions and most of the naming conventions are not self-explanatory.  My Esky H6800 came with a fully licensed copy of  IP Camera Super Client which is a much more advanced security camera monitoring software.  Foscam does sell a program called Blue Iris for $45 though, and you do see a lot of their CS reps recommending customer to buy it to fix the problem with their crappy software.  One might get the idea that they are intentionally giving you crappy software in the hopes that your frustration with it will drive you to buy some more stuff from them.<br /><br />  CAMERA FUNCTION<br />Once you get around all the software problems, and get the cameras properly configured, the cameras work okay.  They have a decent image and a very good wide angle.  Since I got them for monitoring and alerting me to movement at my grandparent's front door, this is the function that is most important to me, so this is what I will focus on.  The cameras do a decent job of sensing movement and setting off an alert.  In my case, I use the email function.  I set up a custom gmail account just for these cameras and installed the K9 Android app on my Galaxy Skyrocket using the IMAP Push protocol to receive email alerts from the camera (so I could use a different alert tone from my other email apps).  This all works great and I receive alerts when the cameras are triggered with in seconds.<br /><br />I am very happy with this setup, except for one thing.  The cameras are very sensitive to changes in light.  Because of this, they are constantly sending out false positives.  This especially true at night because of car headlights.  Every time a car drives down the street I get an alert, even though the cameras are pointed at the door and not the street.  I have played with all the settings to overcome this, but to no avail.  I contacted Foscam's customer support about this issue in a chat session.  Here is the dialog from that chat session.<br /><br />>Agent 2<br />>Hi there! Did you have any questions?<br /><br />>Customer<br />>Yes. How can I reduce false positives do to changes in light on my FI89103W IP cams?<br /><br />>Agent 2<br />>light sensor is sensitive thus, you will get false alarm . only solution is reducing the >sensitivity of alarm<br /><br />>Customer<br />>I have reduced them to a level that even a person waving their arms in front of them >won't set them off and yet I am still getting false alarms do to light changes.<br /><br />>Agent 2<br />>This is a common issue because of the light sensor<br /><br />>Customer<br />>These are new cameras. Are you suggesting that there is no solution and that I should >return them to Fsocam and get my money back?<br /><br />>Agent 2<br />>sure you can, if are not satisfied with the product you can surely do that.<br /><br />The one thing I can say about \\""Agent 2\\"" was at least she or he) was honest about the problems with their products and the companies lack of concern about fixing the problem.  The statement \\"" This is a common issue because of the light sensor\\"" shows that Foscam knows that this is a problem.  The statement that I should just return the product just shows that Foscam has no intention of trying to correct the defects with their product.  It is kind of a \\""Take it or leave, we don't really care\\"", attitude.  I know this, my cheap $65 Esky H6800 does not have problems with false triggering due to light changes like these foscam FI8903W's do.  That is not to say that Esky H6800 is a great camera either, but it does show that this light sensing problem is fixable if foscam cared to address it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you compare my Esky H6800 to the Foscam FI8904W, here is what you get.<br /><br />  Esky H6800<br /><br />1.

Outdoor - Silver",Camera,1,3,4,N,Y,Junk,"After checking out various products, I purchased this camera to monitor my driveway.  The price was decent and although I was put off by all the negative reviews for this product, I took the plunge.<br /><br />I found the software easy to set up and got the camera working in wireless mode very quickly.  However, after that, everything went down hill.  The physical camera has a large wire coming out of the back when a small, thin wire is all that is needed.  This is a terrible design flaw, because in addition to the power line, there is a cable for reset and another cable for the LAN interconnect, both of which are only needed one time, at setup.  You have to either drill a very big hole in your wall to get this cable through, or you can leave the two unnecessary cables exposed to the weather and run the thin power cable through your wall or window, as I did.<br /><br />The mounting bracket is cheesy and broke right away when I tried to mount the camera to it.  Fortunately, I had another laying around and used that.<br /><br />After finally getting the camera installed on the side of the building, I aimed it and then went inside to make some final adjustments to the contrast and brightness.  When I changed the settings for those items, the camera went blank and stopped communicating altogether.  I took the whole thing down, ran through the setup again and it worked fine.  But after reinstalling the camera on the mounting bracket it does not communicate or show the picture at all.<br /><br />I have already spent too much time messing with this thing.

But don't be fooled, this is a great lens, IF you use it right. Like any high powered lens, it has certain requirements. It has a fixed aperture of f/8 at 650mm, f/16 at 1300mm. So hand holding isn't a real option, focusing is difficult due to the magnified camera shake. Put it on a STRONG tripod, not a flimsy one. I use a Bogen with a gear head. On a Nikon D7000, at 650mm , I get focus confirmation in the viewfinder. Easy to focus, even just visually on the focus screen.<br /><br />Images are sharp! Some chromatic aberration, purple fringing on highlights, to be expected, but not severe.<br /><br />I can't give it 5 stars, only because of the tripod mount. Needs improvement. I used JB Weld and dedicated a QR plate to it, now it's rock solid on there. Opteka, take notice here, improve the tripod mount!<br /><br />In use, understand some limitations. At distances over a few miles, expect a little softness and lower contrast due to atmospheric haze and heat waves, especially at 1300mm. Depth of field is what you get, and it's short.<br /><br />And if you don't know how to manually use your cameras, your results will vary. If you handhold this lens, low light, ASA of 100, program mode and end up with shaken, not stirring images, DON'T blame the lens, you're breaking all the rules of engagement required with any high powered optic. LEARN your manual mode, use higher ASA and shutter speeds, and least a monopod in good light, and you'll get surprisingly good images.<br /><br />Personally, I won't be using the 1300mm setting. 650mm cropped will do the same thing, probably better due to lowered camera shake magnification, and the 2 f/stop gain, and resulting harder focus. Plus when you extend the rear tube, you're sucking dust into the lens. Do that back and forth a few times, and you're going to be contaminating the inside, including pollen and mold spores that ultimately eat your glass alive, and quickly so in humid environments.<br /><br />40 years in photography has taught me that you get what you pay for. But every now and then, some really exceptional gear comes along for a drop dead good price. This lens is an example of that rare exception.<br /><br />I think Opteka is looking to gain market momentum by offering this lens at such a low cost. Only recommendation I'd make to them is a better tripod mount, and a re-release of this lens as a sealed 650mm prime, with no zoom. With today's 16-24 megapixel bodies, cropped images will be just as good, if not better than zoomed images<br /><br />I rarely write reviews on Amazon, but this lens is worthy of it.",1/6/2014

The images are soft, it's flimsy and it's awkward to use. But the only lens I have to compare it to is the $18,000 800mm Nikkor so for &lt;$250 it's pretty darn decent.<br /><br />First, check carefully. This lens kit comes with the lens itself (of course) and a Nikon T-mount. Some of the flavors out there have a 2x teleconverter as well for about the same price. Again, you get what you pay for in the teleconverter department and I'm sure my Tokina 3x outperforms the 2x some packages have. Other flavors may omit the T-mount.<br /><br />The lens is pretty awkward to use. The push/pull zoom takes some getting used to, but the focus is also very far forward so when zoomed all the way out you really need to stretch. Zooming will also kill the focus so you'll need to readjust. Frankly, I don't know why this is a zoom except to make the thing a little less unwieldy for transport. Were it not for the length I would much prefer a 1300mm prime to avoid the zoom from vacuuming air (and dust) into the camera body.<br /><br />Shooting with a lens of this focal length takes skill. You'll want a steady tripod, a cable release or wireless remote, and to research mirror lockup shooting. With this combination it's possible to get reasonable shots even at 1300mm with a 3x TC for 3900mm total. The lens meters fine on my Nikon Df, but I wouldn't be surprised if other cameras needed manual shooting mode. You may also want to use LiveView (if available) and zoom in to set the focus - this may be easier/more accurate than the viewfinder for some.<br /><br />However, watch for windy days. The lens is pretty flimsy and the wind will cause it to vibrate and ruin the shot. Having some sort of wind block nearby would help.<br /><br />While the lens itself has caps, the T-mount doesn't. I can't see a reason to ever remove the T-mount unless you need to move it between camera types. As such, I'd recommend something like a [[ASIN:B0045TYDNC Nikon LF-4 Rear Lens Cap]]. The only problem is the lens won't fit nicely into the case with this extra length. However, it still fits well enough for me.<br /><br />The foot does have a 1/4\\"" threaded mount that will allow you to use a [[ASIN:B007P8HV2K Desmond P-70 70mm QR Lens Plate Arca Compatible Dual Dovetail and D-Ring P70 DP-70]] if that's your thing. The problem is the lens zoom travel is huge so you'll probably never get the lens to appear to be balanced properly. Add to that the aforementioned flimsiness and you'll probably want to keep a hand on or near your camera - just in case.<br /><br />Net summary:<br />If you want to mount a small telescope to your camera this is a very cost-effective way to do so. It's priced like an impulse-buy compared to most lenses which makes it a toy worth investing in, but I wouldn't expect to get anything you take with it on the cover of National Geographic.The only problem is the lens won't fit nicely into the case with this extra length.

So this camera/housing/substrobe is one very powerful system as designed. I have been using Ikelite housings for about fifteen years, and this housing is very representative of other DSLR Ikelite housings, which have many recieved quite nice reviews elsewhere. This particular housing is not some piece of unique substandard Ikelite engineering as one may think after reading the earlier review. The buttons on the housing seem to all work just fine for me, and I really don't mind how the strobes hook up, it's all quite functional. Regarding the \\""poor quality shims\\"" for the lens, they seem to work just fine. Yes they are made from flexible foam rubber with a glue strip on one side, but this seems to me to be a quite inexpensive way to assure a good grip on the lens whatever it's diameter happens to be. And the fact that they are inexpensive seems to me to be an advantage, for if they ever malfunction or start to slip, new strips and extra strips can be ordered from Ikelite for very little cost, and with very easy replacement. But really, to me it seems there is little likelihood of failure, and a very minor and cheaply fixable issue if it ever did happen. Plus, you get the flexibility of using a wide variety of wide angle and macro lenses with this simple manner of adjustability (the foam strips come in different thicknesses depending on the  particlar width of the lens you choose to pair it with). To me, the housing itself seems very robust, and as mentioned, quite typical of the Ikelite range, which housings have satisfied many underwater photographers just fine over the years. I am really exited I got all the features which were important to me in one package! My first photos and videos do look very nice indeed!",7/5/2014

Frankly, every flash I've read about regardless of brand seems to get nailed for this reason. Clearly, if you push the flash with several bursts within a short period, it will overheat. However, the same is true with Canon and Nikon based on their product reviews as well. You simply have to work within its design and limitations. The only other solution is to have a second flash to change out when this occurs.<br /><br />BTW,  I opted for this model versus the newer flash HVL-F60AM simply because the 'F58  has received higher reviews than the new 'F60.

Don't bother if you're looking for simple point & shoot candids.  This Flash is WAY overkill for that.<br /><br />My wife is the Pro Photographer and uses the now aging Sony A-700 with maximum firmware upgrades.  The A-700 camera has a near-fatal software flaw in that it does NOT remember the settings from power off to power on.  Annoying!  But what has that got to do with this great, if over-the-top Flash?  Well, you have to remember to set the Flash Settings every time or you're going to get squirrelly results.<br /><br />Once set, the Flash - with great batteries - can bang off an incredible number of fast rounds as one hunts cameos on-the-fly.  This Flash is capable of lighting a 100 X 50 foot room perfectly.  For closer work get a great diffuser - we use the Gary Fong LightSphere Collapsible Inverted Dome Flash Diffuser - for solid and even stunning results.<br /><br />However, this Flash assumes that YOU have done your homework and necessary experimentation before completely trusting your Flash results.  This may seem a &#34;Duh!&#34; to many but this Flash is just not for the Pro wannabe.  If YOU don't prepare the Flash may well ruin that once-in-a-lifetime shot because YOU weren't ready.  Train hard and the rewards will really cut down on all that Photoshopping afterwards.<br /><br />Once you understand this amazing Flash powerhouse the sky's the limit with what you can do with it.

Read my review.,"I bought this for my P2V and actually put the stock camera AND my Evo 3D smartphone on it! One on one side, one on the other. Wasn't easy to get it to work. Lots of balancing and modifying.<br /><br />As far as just putting the stock camera on it, the plug that goes into the back of the stock camera is a bit stiff and the gimbal may have to fight it a little at times so it isn't really perfect.  You will have to open the model (DJI Phantom) and do some soldering to set it all up. You will also need to get the 'tall' landing gear to have enough ground clearance underneath. A few more mods may also be required to get it just right. The motors do seem to heat up if you leave it on and just sitting there. Doesn't seem to be a problem when you're flying the model (but it's cold outside right now which makes me worry about when the summertime comes).<br /><br />The gimbal is a bit heavy but works fairly well. Flight time will decrease a bit (or a lot in my case with an extra smartphone on it). I'd recommend it but look around for the best price.  I think you can find it for about $60. Good luck (you may need some to get it to work perfectly).  Happy flying!",1/17/2015

But how does Robert Chou do great things for free with his IP Cam Viewer for smartphones, including listing Ubiquiti cameras as supported by him, for free, when others, including this software developer have trouble with more powerful Windows machines.  I don't understand it but a number of 3d party vendors do mention this camera....it's just that it doesn't seem to have that great of an image in low light levels or even daylight to differentiate it, cost-wise, from cheaper cameras plus it doesn't give you audio or PTZ.  I know this company does some good things with AP's, etc., but  manufacturers need to remember that when the average buyer purchases a complicated car, that seller doesn't expect the buyer to dig into the guts of the car to make the Goodyear tires work on the Toyota wheels with Brand X gas and Brand Y oil.  I've set up several different brands of wireless and wired DVR's, IP cams, servers, etc.  and this isn't one of the easier ones so i expected a significantly better image in exchange.  Disappointed.

I am using a Dropcam Pro as a reference, and with both at 720p, the Aircam image is comparatively very poor. You can switch the aircam resolution from 720p to 480p and see very little change in the image.<br />Also the dropcam 135 degree wide angle is a plus in my application, versus the approx. 45 degree view of the aircam.<br /><br />On the plus side, I like that I am able to run my own server at a reasonable cost with the aircam. With the Dropcam you're pretty much hooked into a $10/month charge for the rest of your life. The free AirVision software for the Aircam is pretty good. I'm running it under Ubuntu on an old macbook running a Parallels virtual machine. Since the motion detection software runs on the camera, my old macbook has enough power to run the server --- it struggles with other cameras and software where the motion detection is on the server.<br /><br />With Airvision you can set up motion detection zones with arbitrarily complex shapes. You can't set up individual alert policies for the different zones, however. You have have to receive alerts from all zones of a camera or none. The alerts do include the name of the zone, so I use email filters manage the alerts I want to see.

Using all the settings and endlessly fiddling with the focus which is very touchy I could never get a picture that was as sharp as the less expensive Foscam. Yes the Foscam is lower resolution and a narrower field of view, but heck for the higher price of the Aircam I had expected more. Ubiquiti makes some stellar radios for internet bridging and routers which were so surprising that I keep on buying more. This was not the case with the entry level Aircam, the surprise was that the value was not as good as the rest of Ubiquiti's product line. Another downside was the web interface, the shipping firmware has a full feature settings web interface, if you try to manage the cameras with the NVR software it forces you to upgrade the software to a higher version which basically neuters the web interface of all the settings.

I bought this bag for my mirrorless camera and accessories. This bag is more than big enough for The camera and all of its peripherals.  My first impression when I received it was &#34;WOW!&#34;, it is much bigger than I had expected. It also appears to be very well made; the stitching is tight and even and the shoulder strap has a really comfortable adjustable pad on it which is very well thought out because it can be moved along the strap so it is comfortable however you carry it. The strap is also long enough that you can sling it across your chest for comfort and added security. All buckles and rings are metal and very sturdy. The top flap has internal and external zippered pockets and all zippers are very substantial and smooth operating.  The top closure on the bag itself is very well thought out. It is a full width heavy duty double zipper that is attached to the bases of the shoulder strap and when the bag is being carried, pulls the opening shut.  The main compartment is spacious and reasonably well padded and one suggestion I would make for improvement, would be to cover a larger area of the compartment with the fuzzy side of the Velcro to give you a little more choice as to how you place the dividers. The bag is also equipped with a water proof nylon rain cover that stows away in a zippered compartment in the rear of the bag.  All in all this is an exceptional value in terms of &#34;bang for your buck&#34; and I definitely recommend it.",7/21/2015

The bag is very well made. The stitching is very nice and all the materials seem to be very good quality. I removed the dividers and can fit my Canon Rebel with the lens attached and lens hood on and not reversed, my ipad, and still have room for a book. There are plenty of pockets for batteries and charger, extra card and passport. I agree with all of the odd aspects that have been commented on by others. The side pockets with the lacing is the most troubling. It's just plain strange looking. One reviewerr did not realize that the zip out bottom on one side creates a place to carry a tripod. Clever I'd say, just wish it didn't have the laces. My solution has been to untie the laces from the base of the strap and tuck the tops of the side pockets into themselves. It just makes them a little less noticable. I'm hoping to come up with an alternative to the laces. Maybe they just fly free. The straps for the tripod on the bottom of the bag are another issue that's been commented on. You have to cut off the ends of the straps to remove the straps from the bag. I appreciate the care of sewing on the end tabs. I guess it would keep you from losing a strap but I'd like to be able to remove them without cutting. In the end though, you can't beat this bag for the price. It's a very good size and very well made but it does have those weird side pockets.",8/8/2015

So don't think you're buying this for the free software.  But when I tried the telescope out for the first time on shadowed lunar craters, Venus's crescent, and Jupiter's two large bands and four largest moons (just dots in this small scope, but beautiful to see, nonetheless), I knew I had made the correct decision buying this telescope.  The optics are much sharper than those of either of the previous inexpensive telescopes I've owned, and each of the views I described in the previous sentence were considerably brighter and more clear than any I had experienced with those instruments.  Be sure to buy this version with the Barlow lens or purchase one later if you do not.  Also, the Orion 13 percent white light filter, available through Amazon for $19.99, would be a good idea for lunar viewing.  This telescope is not going to be the one for observing dim star pairs or clusters or distant galaxies, but it is very compact and surprisingly easy to maneuver.  The auto-tracking mount is also surprisingly functional in light of the low price.  Overall, though, the main advantage is that this telescope is so small and compact, which helps in setting up and taking down an observing position quickly.  I was lucky enough to find an unusually sturdy table mounted on a tripod that is perfect for this purpose at an antique store.  You will want to search for some sort of similarly stable table that can be set at a comfortable position for viewing while seated or standing.  Net assessment:  A great buy!",6/24/2015

Maybe it's just me but I find it hard to compose in the screen and in bright light conditions, the screen is hard to see, making it even harder to judge what you're framing up for your shot and what the image-lighting is going to look like).<br />Overall, a great camera for anyone who doesn't want to invest in a full sized digital cam like the D200 / D300 models.

Paid about $60 us to ship it from Barbados to America. After having to call to find out my quote seeing their were taking so long, I found out why it cost around $180.00 us to get it fixed, I asked the representative why it cost so much,,,,seeing that all I had to do was put a few more dollards and get a new one,,,, she was uncouth, or lets just simply say not nice, and told me that was the price. May I add that their website is not user friendly and trying to contact them I found it easier to call,,,,, for me an international user that is not cheap.....soooooo I then received  a quote in the mail then I saw the breakdown that shipping was costing me around $80 somethingUS and I was like,,, if only the young lady had explained this I would have been more understanding as to why it came to that much. Mind you I used UPS shipping thinking I had prepared shipping back to Barbados, only to find out that, they gave me wrong information more bad customer service. To make a long story short I end up calling Nikon several times only to be met with either rough customer service representatives who do not understand international customers.  I had a couple people lined up who were coming to Barbados where I would get them bring it for me on their way back from their vacation in NY, but they simply take too long to give details in terms of repairs and how long something would take. All in all I want a camera company who can respond fast and be understanding when I have a problem...........the camera works ok, but like some I have to agree the focus takes too long and you get some blury pictures along the way, but the customer representatives leaves a bad taste in my mouth for Nikon...they need to take a leaf out of Amazon's book.",10/18/2013

I have had it for a few years, so I feel like I know it well enough to give the CoolPix L810 a decent review. First, it is easy to use and provides several functions that offer the photographer an opportunity to select options for just about any type of environment.  I love the video function and use it quite often. The quality of images is no better than other cameras that I had but no worse either.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that it tends to shut down and quit working when it is cold. I was unable to get good shots inside of a penguin house at the zoo because it was tool cold inside. Getting outside during the winter is also a risk. While it may work for a few minutes, a few minutes is about all you will get out of it. I also feel it too slow to respond when changing functions, or switching from video to photo.",9/2/2014

You always need to remove the lens cap to turn it on even just to look at the pictures otherwise it'll give you a warning.  The thing that really makes me mad is that the aspect ratio is off.  This means any setting, any size you select through the menu is not going to fit on a standard 4x6 or 5x7 picture when printing them out.  You will always end up cutting the top and bottom off or the left and right sides.  I bought a Sony NEX for my girlfriend for about $100 more.

The images on the computer screen looked like they were make out of sand the grittiness was so bad under enlargement, I have old 4mp cameras that perform better. The edges are a bit soft on the lens, backlit subject create it to mis-focus and video zoom freezes randomly. On top of that it can take forever to find focus when shooting video.

UPDATED,"Takes about a dozen (decent) pics before batteries die.  I've seen numerous web posts re the stinking battery life.  thin Cam should be recalled/replaced.  If they don't fix this, Nikon hasscrewed any future prospect of me ever buying another of their products.    UPDATE  Short story is, It was the batteries.   After writing the above review, I parked the camera on a shelf. After many months I ran out of the Alkaline AA's that were working fine in flashlights, etc. but not in the cam.    So I ordered another box of AA's but for some reason I had to get a different brand.  On a hunch I dusted off the L810 & tried it with the new batteries.  Well the new batteries are much better that the old maxells and the camera has been reborn.  I get hundreds of pics between batt changes now, long video tracks, Lots of Flash & good battery shelf life inside the camera.    I now give it 4 stars. I just don't think the menus allow for quick enough changes during fast changing events or situation, and the lag between pressing the button & the instant of exposure, ruins too many pics... and it takes a bit long to rearm between exposures.   But when all the stars align, it takes a great picture.",10/13/2013

The zoom is pretty awesome for a point and shoot, but naturally loses some of the sharpness if zoom is too far extended.  It does very well taking close-ups of food and flowers with bright clear colors.

I rated this camera with four starts and not five just because I found one issue that didn't like.  It is that the camera is not very fast processing shooting pictures.  What I want to say is that the camera takes around two or three seconds to get ready to take a second shot.  This is not really nice when you are trying to take pictures of an event that is happening very fast (or faster than regular events).  I even set the camera for the sport events, and noticed that the camera is slow getting ready from one shot to another.<br />Besides that little detail, the camera is very compact, light, has good resolution, and contains many features that are still great to take great pictures.  I like the zoom, and it is of great quality.  I would recommend buying this camera if you are interested in getting pictures of great quality, indoor or outdoor.  Just keep in mind that it is not good for taking multiple pictures.",3/13/2014

Some of the best images ever!,"I've been out of the camera scene for a while, so when I decided to get a nice camera I searched for the most megapixels for the buck. What I discovered when I purchased the CoolPix L810 (Spring 2013) is that besides 16.1 mp, I got a camera with awesome glass! I'm not always a fan of point and shoot, but my budget at the time didn't allow for a more serious camera- but the lens on this camera is great.<br />  The advanced features of auto focus and scene selection (everything a point and shoot can do) makes for one heck of a great camera. Plus the impressive HD video has me budgeting for a second L810 camera for videoing my son's band on stage from two vantage points. The lens quality on this camera convinced me to choose Nikon for a more serious camera (D3100, Summer 2013).<br />  Be aware that as with all CCD sensors, if there is a bright light source in the field of view while videoing, the light will bleed on the sensor itself, causing a light line from top to bottom (CMOS sensors like my D3100 don't do this). The trick is, don't have bright light sources in the field of view while videoing- however with band's on stage- the effect is acceptable and appropriate.<br />  When photographing, the batteries seem to last months. When videoing, you can get about 8 to 10 hours of robust charge.<br />  So if you want the best bang for the buck for megapixels, automation and beautiful sharp images and your budget is 200 to 250... get this particular CoolPix camera.",8/18/2013

I still use the Coolpix, which was quickly repaired, although not until after our trip. On cruises, I keep it near the balcony door of our stateroom, for shots of the ocean, sunset, ships and passing sea creatures. It does a nice job. In all honesty. I had an early ELPH before the Nikon and it's lens got stuck too! While the Nikon may give a better quality, it's heavy to carry around on shore excursions and I do a lot of one-handed shots outside the window of a tour bus with the little elph. That said, the Nikon L810 is smaller, much lighter and easier to use than my daughters NIKON DSLR which she uses for business. I'm happy with photo quality suitable for Facebook.",5/18/2015

I can't seem to get the shutter speed to work with me no matter what function I'm in (sport/pet/etc) or how still something is. Zoom works perfectly, but again, the object has to be not moving or you'll miss it by the time it snaps the picture. Another thing I've noticed recently is that the zoom (buttons both around the capture button and on the side of the lens area) takes between five and ten seconds at times to respond when you attempt to change it. It's better than nothing but at this rate I might as well use my cell phone camera to compensate for shutter speed and just crop out what I don't want in the picture.",8/14/2013

If you allow it to focus, it takes magnificent photos. I took photos of my daughter's wedding just a few days after receiving the camera. My photos were mostly indistinguishable from those taken by the professional photographer they hired. I used it a few months later to take some beautiful photos on Vieques Island. My only complaint is the audio when using the camera to record video. The tiny built-in microphones have a poor low end, making everything sound thin. My cell phone records better audio. I wish it had some way to hook in external microphones. I do have a digital audio recorder I could use to record the audio and then sync it with the video, but what a pain. Oh well, for the price I guess you can't have everything.",12/4/2013

This was my first upgrade camera from using  basic ~$100 Nikon models like the P60 and L28 (although my very first was a Kodak easy share).<br /><br />Pros:<br />~I chose the camera in Blue. The color is rich and I haven't had any major issues with it chipping.<br />~My cameras come with me everywhere, so it's been through a lot and is holding up pretty well. I have dropped it once (only about 3 months ago) and it only sustained a corner chip (that's all that is apparent). The performance of the camera has not been affected.<br />~When the lighting is high, especially on sunny days, photos are stunning and crisp, especially macros (the type of photos I take most often).<br />~This camera takes SD cards, so it was an easy upgrade (although later I purchased an SD with a higher class to improve recording on card speed).<br />~You can fit quite a bit in the shot when lense is fully zoomed out.<br />~ (might be a con for some people)Although it isn't a DLSR, it kind of looks like one.Some people have even asked me which Nikon DLSR it was! It's my dream to own a DLSR, but I don't have the money for that yet (college is expensive). This camera feels similar to a DLSR when you hold it (as close to the dream as I can get, for now).<br /><br />Neutral:<br />*Because the lense is a little too big for the camera, sometimes wider shots will have curve distortions in the corners. It's not significant enough to bother me, and I have actually used this defect to take some awesome, creative perspective shots.<br />*Manual setting: The manual light/exposure setting is OK. The camera can be finicky.<br />*Setting: Sometimes settings within the camera are sometimes difficult to find, such as formatting card. This is frustrating when I need to work quickly because my subjects don't always wait for me (organisms).<br />*The lense has to be open/exposed too review pictures. I would have liked it if there was an option to \\""close lense\\"" while reviewing pictures. My cheap $50 FujiFilm that I take along when fishing automatically closes its lense after you start reviewing images about 1 minute.<br />*Darker lighting shots and extreme contrast lighting tend to be very warm. This can usually be fixed with software, but I've had instances where there was no hope.<br /><br />Negative:<br />*Using the flash: Occasionally when I need the flash and pop it up (esp. for dark macro shots), the camera doesn't recognize this and I have to fight with the camera to accept the flash manually.<br />*Lense is very easy to destroy. Only a month after owning this camera, there was already dust under the lense. I always keep the cap on, and I never exposed my lense to extreme wind or beach conditions. The dust is not visible in most shots, but I know it is there. At certain zoom levels, one of the dust specs create a blurry spot. I am pretty sure that Nikon would fix this problem if I sent the camera in, but it's probably expensive. I never looked into it, though(and I dislike paying shipping).<br />*Dark lighting; This was my BIGGEST disappointment from this camera. It's horrible for low-light situations. My friend's cell phone camera was getting better quality low-light photos than me. Whenever I want a low-light shot, such as a picture of a moth at night, I have to wear a head light and hold a flashlight in my left hand while trying to take a picture. When I use the flash, it only works for objects close-mid distance away. Very close objects get super-exposed, and father objects are non-existent. Also, as the lighting gets darker, the fuzzies get harsher. I know, this isn't a pro-camera. But I would have liked it to handle low light a little better for the price.<br />*Energy monster: The camera takes (4) AA batteries. No battery packs here. This thing is a battery monster that's ALWAYS hungry. I have rechargeable AA batteries for it now, but not always. Before investingin rechargables, it was a bad situation.<br />*Focus: Like I said, I love taking macros/ close-ups. Sometimes the focus takes way too long, and very often it's challenging to get the right focus. For example, I want to get a close-up of a dragonfly. The camera will focus the face or the body, but not both. Whatever it doesn't focus is very blurry. I want a crisp, all-focus closeup. That might be asking too much for a camera like this, but I really don't know. I don't have enough experience to make such a judgement.<br />*Speed: The camera is much faster than my previous, but still too slow for quick, action shots like animals running. These shots tend to be clearer the more you zoom out, but sometimes I want detail. I tend to get these shots indirectly. I take a video of the action, then use editing software (like Picasa) to extract photos from the video. These \\""photos\\"" are not as crisp as a regular picture, but they allow me to capture things like lightning. There is a super-fast continuous mode that puts 16 photos on one frame. You can extract individual photos from this frame later, but they have to be blown up, and that sacrifices clarity.<br /><br />So, the L810 gets 4 stars overall because it is a nice improvement/upgrade from cheaper cameras. I do like it, but it can be frustrating when I can not capture the shots that I envision. Plus, it's dark-lighting shots are simply awful.<br />You might have more experience with cameras than me and could probably make better judgements of my complications. Or you might have less experience and feel a little overwhelmed by all the reviews for all the cameras you are looking at.<br />No matter who you are, the ultimate decider is YOU. This is my experience and you'll need to judge and digest it to decide if the L810 will satify you needs as a photographer.in rechargables, it was a bad situation.<br />*Focus: Like I said, I love taking macros/ close-ups.

Just like I said in the X3 review, I think it's an absolute joke that plasma is being fazed out and we are stuck with inferior LCD's that still have the same issues since day one! But since when did the better technology ever win out?!? It's always profit and misinformation that does. Nothing out there beats plasma and nothing ever will. Plasma's have all the advantages that LCD's will never be able to topple such as off axis viewing, black levels and motion capabilities.The makers of LCDΓÇÖs try and copy the attributes of the plasma each year with their substandard 'improvements'. Epic fail. LED's is nothing but marketing hype. It's still an LCD with the same issues mentioned above. I also have a Pioneer Elite Kuro and it's still to this day the Gold standard to which tv's are compared to. If any of my plasma's ever fail, they will get repaired! Hanging on for them for as long as I can since there is nothing on the horizon that is any better, except for perhaps OLED. But the jury is still out on that. So keep your plasma if you have one or find one on the internet even used if you have to. This G15 has an excellent an picture with decent blacks,not Kuro blacks by any means but still better than any LCD, and good shadow detail as typical for plasma's. We've had this tv for several years now and it's been a wonderful set! I bought this set for my mother several years when this model was first introduced and it's still going strong. One thing about plasma's is that it's like fine wine. Picture gets better and better with age as the phosphorus break in. I ran the Spears and Munsell calibration disc and found that the Standard or Custom mode dialed in the best out of all the picture modes. THX was a little too dim if you don't have it in a dark room. Maybe the only negative about this tv is the sound. But that's the case with a lot of flat panels. A receiver would fix that problem and it has audio out for a simple analog connection to a basic stereo receiver. That's about it. Keep your plasma!",4/12/2015

Cheap junk. Not worth it at any price.,"I purchased this Chinese manufactured lens kit back in March. I fiddled with it, noticed that it was very difficult to focus, especially with the zoom over 800 or 900mm. That's because it really doesn't have special dot optics built in to help you tell if you are focused or not. You just have to judge from the image you see in the viewfinder. Zoom is a slide. Focus is not a real precise mechanism, near impossible over 1000mm zoom (Never used the junky 2x multiplier that came in the kit). I used a good solid tripod and detached shutter release to minimize camera jitter when the photo is snapped. I found in the field, while taking photos in Yellowstone park of wildlife that this lens was just not any good for getting any kind of photograph with any quality. With my Canon EOS T2I, I found using my trusty Canon EF 70-300 IS USM zoom lens with a 1.4x multiplier (Not the one that comes in this kit) gives far FAR better quality photos that, if necessary, I can crop with Corel PaintShop pro 17 with quality results.<br /><br />The single pod that comes with the kit makes a good walking stick, which was the only thing I found useful in this kit.<br /><br />No doubt I'm an amateur photographer who truly enjoys his hobby, but...I've been using telephoto lenses to photograph in Yellowstone since 1973. It's not like I don't have a decent understanding of or didn't give this too cheep to be true lens a good workout.<br /><br />As cheep and as tempting as it is, save your money by not buying this one. It was just too big of a waste of time, and kept me from getting some what should of been really good wildlife shots on my last photographic trip to Yellowstone park.",10/10/2014

Pro football photographers/cameramen, to national geographic. I know a little bit about cameras and i've been around the block. This lens defies the odds of price. My friend who is a regular photographer of football games in the Maryland area, (ravens/redskins) has a few telephoto lenses that are into the $20k range. They need a tripod pretty much to use. but they feel solid. Thats pretty much what 20k is going to get you is the lens is going to feel expensive. Quality however? this lens can top them even when zoomed in. Ive used it with a canon mark 3 for video and stills on a tripod of course...and wow, was i surprised. The lens is mostly plastic, the levers are alittle loose and zooming in and out is a pain, but like all camera equipment, you just get used to it after about 10 mins of fooling with it. Use a tripod if shooting anywhere but direct sunlight. Seriously. even in the late evening.<br />Overall this is an EXCELLENT lens for the price, you simply can't beat that price for the amount of zoom you get. It may feel a little cheap, but hey, beggars cant be choosers, plus it gets the job done. Words of wisdom for this lens though...get a tripod.

Not a deal breaker though, just takes little extra force.<br />- Reflector works well.<br />- Velcro is a little lightweight and could use a 1/2\\"" strip or a quick strap to enforce the dome for extended work.<br /><br />Overall a decent buy as a cheaper alternative.  I don't use this type of modifier much so buying both a clear and cloud (diffused) knockoff version for 1/2 the cost of a single fong dome made sense.

You will struggle so hard trying to point this camera where you want it because its not on a ball swivel; as previously mentioned an elbow joint with a horrible adjustment ring near camera.  It's just bad, awful, stupid, ridiculous, you will be screaming at the engineers who made this things its that bad.  This is the one at Costco with 8 cameras.

The remote view options on an external network require some configuration that can be confusing.<br /><br />Installation was not to bad.  Hung a camera on the four corners of my house under the sofit.  I put a piece of 2x4 just above the sofit so I had something to mount the camera to.  Stringing the cables through the attic was the worst part, but the cables were plenty long enough to reach all the cameras.<br /><br />Clarity of the video is good.  You won't be able to read license plates or anything like that, but you can identify people pretty well.<br />Night vision is good, but video clarity is reduced as well as visual range as you are relying on the invisible light put off by the camera.<br />I purchased the 1 TB DVR and with all four cameras recording constantly it can store 6 days worth of video.  It automatically overwrites old video once it's full.<br />Being able to view video from my home PC and Android smartphone while connected to my home internet is no problem.  I have had problems setting up remote view from an external network however.  It requires port forwarding on your router.  Lorex does have a handy tool that will do this for you, but I had to do some serious digging online to even find it.  This seems to be the biggest problem with these systems is being able to view them remotely.  Some very detailed guides on how to do this should be front page of their support site, instead you have to dig for it.  I feel like I finally got everything set up and working correctly, but the internet at my work actually blocks the traffic, so I can't even use it anyways.<br /><br />Install Tips:<br />1- The ends of the cables are different, so only one end will plug into the camera and one end into the DVR, so make sure you  pay attention to this when stringing the cables.<br />2- Buy a &#34;Steel Fish Tape&#34; to help pull the cables from the attic to the outside.  I bought a 25' Klein brand from Home Depot andit helped out running the cables.  Extended the fish tape up through the sofit and hung it off my ladder.  Went up into the attic and tapped the end of the cable to the fish tape.  Go back outside and use the fish tape to pull the cable to the outside.",7/23/2015

(City) Remote viewing setup a snap if your smartphone has a camera that can read the unique QR code to register. I did IOS 8.4 (iPhone) in no time just following the quick setup directions ( comes in 5 languages )<br />Only drawback of my install was it was an upgrade from an older system and couldn't use the older style RG6 / RG59 cable. But I was saved by the Cat3 ( 4 conductor copper ) that was run for 12v power from the pre existing install. Just bought some inexpensive ($12 a pair) balun adapters rated for HD CVI (HD over analog) and used the spare pair of wires for the camera and DVR BNC connections. This is a very uncommon problem as all recently manufactured Siamese cable is rated for 3-4K data transmission unlike the older home aluminum core cable.<br />So if it's a new install just use the included Siamese cable and it's a snap. For really long runs (over 100 ft.) use Cat 5 and the balun / power adapters for the ends. Good for 700 meters that way. Customer service was good also which is important.,7/13/2015

Can't even tell what model of a car drives by at night.<br />Motion sensor only works at about 70 ft, so anything that moves farther in the background won't be detected by the motion sensor.<br />Over all is an ok system , I don't believe you can get much better for that price.<br />Reason I give it 2 stars is because the IR night vision does not work as described and 720 HD is not all that<br />This might be good enough for some uses or locations ...but If You looking for a quality system I would wait and save some more money.<br />I hope this review helps",6/19/2015

While there is room for improvement in the advanced software tools (time-based selection of which movement grid settings to use would be nice, as would selecting how many beeps the system makes upon sensing movement), but for the price, this system can't be beat and does a very good job of providing a high quality image, both day and night, as well good movement sensing, easy enough menus and click/double click options for changing views quickly. both servers and cameras have been very reliable... I've had a few cameras go to to B&W only, but they seem to switch back to color after a while so no big deal. The reasonably decent remote viewing and control app (FLIR), quickly available from both the android and apple stores, makes it very easy to provide your management staff (or family members) the ability to remote view and control the cameras from a smartphone... along with selectable access per user, based upon accounts you allow them to log into. Overall, a very good system that could use some software feature enhancement, but at the price, I'm giving it 5 Stars!<br /><br />Sure, I'd love to outfit my stores with higher-end IP Cameras and servers like I run at home, but it would be well over twice the price, and 4 times the setup,maintenance/troubleshooting time... just not worth it unless you want to make IP Cameras/Servers your new hobby.<br /><br />I highly reccomend the Lorex 720 systems for both home and business use",1/24/2015

It doesn't feel super secure just hanging on that ring. I would have thought the manufacture could have done something much better where it attaches.

No tools are needed if you change the battery, all you use is a coin to open the battery case. The only gripe I have is it is hard to adjust on a target when it's dark and you lost the target.

I considered a wireless remote, but you can't use it to focus only. The wireless remote would focus and take a picture. You couldn't disable the shot (i.e. shutter release).<br /><br />PROS<br />- This remote is essentially an extension of the shutter-release button on the camera. Works in the same manner:<br />-- Half-press the button to focus the lens (if you have a lens that does auto-focus)<br />-- Full press for shutter-release<br />- There is a &#34;hold&#34; function that allows you to hold down the button, slide it up and lock the shutter open in place for long exposure/night shots<br />- This works in in Live View and during video recordings (do not require start/stop of video). I know some comments said it could not, but it worked on my d5100.<br />- Plug & play functionality. No setup required, no setting changes needed. Just plug it in and it works instantly.<br /><br />I would have given it 5 stars, but there are a few things I would've liked better:<br /><br />CONS<br />- would have liked a longer cable<br />- the button doesn't &#34;click&#34; and have any haptic/tactile feedback when fully depressed, so it's hard to tell if the shot went through until after you hear the shutter release on the camera itself. If you're not close to your camera, and cannot hear the shutter, you may not know if the shot went through or not.<br />- very lightweight, but not in the sense that it is travel friendly, but in a cheaply designed, easy to break manner<br /><br />OVERALL<br />It does everything I wanted and needed it to do. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a remote. I would repurchase this over and over again.",5/2/2014

The cable is a decent length, but I do wish it was a foot or so longer.  If the choice is available to me, I always go with this over the infrared remote.  There is one flaw, however. If you push the button forward while it's down, the remote will hold the shutter open.  That's a great feature, but it's so easy to do on accident that I would keep the shutter open and not feel like I did anything differently.  This would only ruin a picture if you were in bulb mode, but it threw me off the first couple of times it happened.  It would be nice if there was a bit more resistance with that shutter hold.

Why doesn't Canon or Nikon do this with their speedlites?

HOW FREAKING USEFUL IS THAT?! If Canon does not add this functionality to their next version of Speedlites I will be flabbergasted.<br /><br />While the TTL function is probably not very useful for studio or other take-your-time photographers, it is incredibly useful in the Gun-n-Run world of wedding and event photography. You wedding photographers know how lighting conditions can change dramatically in the span of one minute as you run from outdoor portraits to indoor table decor shots.There's no time to bust out your light meter.<br /><br />With this Profoto Air Remote TTL-C, you just set it to TTL, set your ratios (e.g., +0.5 stops on A), take a shot, if it looks good then switch the Profoto Air Remote TTL-C to Manual (one button), and then if you need to tweak your channels up or down, just do it from the Air Remote.

However, I'm not that impressed, somewhat disappointed really. It works very well at its job, providing a nice support for your thumb and therefore gives confidence in the shooter to use the camera with one hand, steady your camera for longer exposures, etc (as all thumb grips do really). However, I do not see a higher fit and finish (overall quality) in this product than its Chinese manufactured competitors which generally cost 1/5-1/3 the price. The silicone inserts are, indeed, a nice addition and an advantage over similar products (I am interested to see how long they will remain attached). At $60, I'm on the very cusp of whether or not to return this item...    Other notes, as an X-E1 owner, you may be very annoyed to see X-E2 engraved on this item despite it's compatibility and marketing for both cameras. If you apply a decent amount of pressure (not an unrealistic amount) on this thumb grip, it causes the item to torque in the hot shoe and back itself out about 1 mm (somewhat annoying). I wish it was screw mounted. This is version II of the X-E1/X-E2 thumb grip by Lensmate. Version I was screw mounted and advertised to be manufactured in the USA, they made this explicitly clear... However, this version II is not explicitly advertised to be manufactured anywhere, it makes me suspicious. Hopefully someone from Lensmate will clear this up.    Not sure why others blindly gave this item 5 stars with two major draw backs... 3-5 times the price of competitors with only a marginal difference in build quality and so-so camera mounting (silicone allows item to wiggle in place a tiny bit).",11/12/2014

This is never coming off the camera. With just the slightest bit of pressure the camera feel and balance has changed dramatically for the better. It perfectly keeps my thumb from spinning the exposure compensation dial but doesn't really interfere with access to the controls... well, the shutter speed dial is a little harder to get to but I'll take the slight inconvenience for the improvement to the camera.<br /><br />The hot shoe on the X-E2 is recessed into the camera top so any torque on the rail from using the thumb grip will be supported in part by it being up against the camera top.<br /><br />The price, it's outrageous, but it really made a difference in how my camera feels in my hand so...

This is by far the best of the knock offs for both quality of manufacture, size and addition of the silicone grips for both thumb and mount.  Works perfectly on both the X-E1 and X-20.  It is just the right length so your thumb falls naturally against the grip and also keeps your thumb away from the LCD or exposure compensation dial.  Very smooth to take on or off and it has a little silicone grip surface on the mounting side too to keep it secure.<br /><br />Save yourself the hassle and disappointment of the other much cheaper generic versions by Fotodiox and Thumbs Up and just buy this version (I have black cameras, the same item is available in silver).",5/9/2014

It does make the camera more stable and secure in my grip especially when holding it with one hand and the longer I use it the more I appreciate it.  Is it expensive? Yes, but given the limited market, it is made to fit the Fuji X-E1/E2 and not a generic fit for multiple cameras I can understand the price.  Is it worth it?  Only you can answer that.

I know these cameras very well. I purchased 2 from these guys in April 2013. I didn't even hook them up until the middle of Sept 2013. They lasted maybe 30 days. No warranty, even though they say there is one. The focus on one won't focus. Yes, I turned the lens ring. The picture won't come up on the other one. The Foscam itself is a good camera for a simple view. I purchased another one from the manufacturer. Much better image quality. I suggest you buy directly from manufacturer, there is a 2 year warranty. I should have known better.",10/12/2013

I set up an FTP server on my computer and had it set to snap pictures of movement. 3 days later, I found pictures of one of my sister's friends. I reported it to the police, gave them the photos. Needless to say he's in jail. Anyway. Enough story time.<br />Pros:<br />It's compact<br /><br />It looks nice<br /><br />it includes hardware to be mounted on a wall or ceiling (i didnt use it, i just hid it on a bookshelf)<br /><br />It's a breeze to set up if you know how to port forward and how to find the MAC address. (FTP is a different story, some routers don't like it)<br /><br />It takes good enough pictures to provide evidence.<br /><br />Has an app, and the camera can be adjusted remotely<br /><br />IR nightvision works amazingly. My basement is the full length of my house (around 50-60 feet) and every single thing is illuminated well, it probably reaches much further because theres a glare on the back wall opposite the camera, but i havn't had a chance to test that.<br /><br />There are plenty more pros, but those are the big ones for me. Now for the cons.<br />Cons:<br />Using the app to access the camera remotely can be a little sluggish.<br /><br />If you arent familiar with your router settings page then it probably isnt super user friendly, however mine came with a card that would allow me to call a technician and have them set up 1 camera for me free of charge.<br /><br />I also included a picture of it on my shelf with an airsoft gun for scale.",6/20/2015

Forget it!,"I tried a few days to get this item to work on Mavericks.  Thinking there was some trick that I must have missed.  The first part, I purchased this like new off Amazon, with a few minor imperfections.  When it came it had no installation CD.  I went to the foscam website, thinking perhaps like other customers, they might help.  Those reviews must be bots, because in a week I have yet to find any customer service rep available by chat.  I called in but they couldn't really assist me with connecting me to someone via chat to screenshare or anything else another reviewer said.  Maybe they were lucky.  I wasn't.  So there aren't really any tutorials for this model and maverick and I eventually gave up.  Amazon will not send the installation CD, and the ip find tool just never worked once.  So I sent this back and got the plug and play 21P.  There's zero information about the 21P's, its all 21W and I was hesitant.<br /><br /> software for mac is only the IP tool on the CD.  But I plugged the thing in my router, and viola, it appeared.  And it was pretty easy after that.  I still have a sneaking suspicion that there's software out there that gives you one price and then after you purchase you see lower prices.  I'm still convinced this is the case, with this particular 10W purchase, and had to buy one a double the price just to find one that worked on my mac.  The 21P works great, but don't put it behind glass for the night.  I don't know what on earth you would use to use the IR at night in a case, none seem to offer any help case wise and renders the feature completely useless.  The browser software does not accept USB camera's that I can figure out.  IP addy or not.  But it does accept multiple camera's for the 21p if you do not wish to convert a usb that I'm aware of.  I never got to see for the 10W :(/  I used evocam, and i got usb, FaceTime and this camera up and going.  Plug & Play is the way to go.",3/13/2014

And I am only doing it to tell you that Foscam indeed has faulty products and they do not stand behind them.  My camera has a reboot issue and it is simply unusable.  I waited too long to have it repaired within the warranty period (because I thought I had done something wrong).  Nevertheless, when I contacted Foscam for help, the only &#34;help&#34; they offered was to tell me that I have to buy a new one.  I was beyond the warranty.  My fault.  I know. But here's the funny part.  I didn't ask for a new camera free of charge.  I asked for help (And I have the email to prove it). I am an engineer and could have fixed it if they gave me the instructions.  However, they didn't offer any help of any sort.  Any reputable company would have at least attempted something. And after reading through the reviews, it seems quite evident that many people have received faulty cameras...and even then...the repair process is quite a hassle.  Thumbs down, Foscam.",8/24/2014

The camera was sporting the new version.<br /><br />Unfortunately once my login cookie expired I was permanently locked out of the camera. The reasoning is as follows: because my old password doesn't meet their new password requirements, which by the way, are arbitrary and awful, it won't log me in.<br /><br />Here's a summary of how the login code works: grab username from input, grab password from input, make sure that the entered password meets the following regex: /((?=.*\d)(?=.*\D)|(?=.*[a-zA-Z])(?=.*[^a-zA-Z]))^.{6,12}$/<br />For the lazy that means it will reject a password of '$5rlK4vZIr 8.#k' but thinks 'Password1' is just great.<br /><br />...

After much consideration, I decided to start with this camera.  Not one of my smarter choices, as it turns out.  First of all, in order to use all of its features controls, you must use Internet Explorer. Firefox and Chrome will operate some, but not all of them.  Secondly, while the camera does have infrared capabilities, the default setting is ON.  You can manually turn it off, but any time the camera reboots (such as during a power loss), the infrared comes back on.  I wanted to install one of the cameras so it was aimed through a window into another, dimly lit, room.  Without the infrared, the camera did an adequate job of showing an image of the room.  With the infrared on, there was nothing but a huge glare off the glass.  Like most products imported from the Far East, the included instructions are a mess of gibberish and broken English making setup a challenge, especially if the user is not a tech wiz at routers, port forwarding, and networking.  You can remotely view the camera over the internet on a smart phone or tablet, however the Android version of the Foscam app falls short of the mark.  Don't waste time on it, there are other third party apps that do a much better job.  Getting assistance from the web site is a waste of time.  They devout a lot of space to marketing information about all of their products, but next to nothing in the way of on-line help.  Calling the tech support phone number is like watching grass grow.  Two different days, waiting over 30 minutes each time, and still no live person to talk to.  Email is no better, after three days, still no response.  That was the final deal breaker for me.<br /><br />In summary, I only gave this one star because there was no option to give it Zero stars.  Even that may be too many.",5/31/2014

I did a ΓÇ£restore factory settingsΓÇ¥ after upgrading to 8.1 and completed all the following steps (tried to keep them sequential in order to be easy to follow as I found all this out through hours of research and trial and error): Exclude the Blue Iris folder (C:/Programs/BlueIris) in Anti-Virus software and if you can, also exclude the IP address for your camera(s) - (Avast ΓÇô settings, troubleshooting, redirect setting, add URL). Complete any troubleshooting on the wireless network you are going to use for your cameras. I have 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands with different ssid (name); Foscam cameras work on 2.4 with b/g so I set that network for the cameras and use everything else on 5GHz band. Windows 8.1 renamed my Ethernet connection same as wireless; I found it easier just to rename my wireless networks in my router and reconnect my devices.  Update: There is a simple registry fix for this I've since found and used - google. Was having an issue with my wireless disconnecting and now it hasnΓÇÖt for quite a while. Install IPCamera.exe to desktop and install IPCWebcomponents.exe (web plugin for Windows). Plug in camera power and then Ethernet cable to router. Double click IPCamera.exe tool on desktop and it should find your Foscam camera. Double click on your camera and install the plugin when prompted. Sign in (youΓÇÖll have to change your password).  Admin is login with no password. Choose Active X mode for IE. Probably have to re-log in after installing the plugin. Update: If you have problems installing the active x control: I added the camera IP address to IE's compatibility view, closed the browser, reopenedIE as administrator and typed camera url to log in rather than using the tool.  I was able to install active x and log on camera.  Logged on as usual since with no problems. Update System Firmware then application, and plugin (youΓÇÖll have to reinstall at next logon); follow instructions on Foscam support site; theyΓÇÖll send you an email with all update after you go to the support page and enter your name and email.  Complete updates with Ethernet connection, not over wireless. Complete updates then log back in using IPCamera.exe tool on desktop. Once you can see your camera, then you can disconnect Ethernet and complete wireless. Go to settings and make any adjustments and remember to submit or save each change as you make them. You can change the name of your camera (I used location). Set time zone, sync to NTP server, set daylight savings if necessary and advance time 60ΓÇÖ. Ensure a static IP address if you donΓÇÖt want any problems.  ItΓÇÖs easy to do and, according to Foscam, itΓÇÖs better to do it in the camera settings than in router settingsΓÇª.just uncheck ΓÇ£Obtain IP from DHCP ServerΓÇ¥ and change the last set of numbers in your IP address.  For example, 192.168.1.xxx to 192.168.1.x.  Your router IP address is probably something like 192.168.1.1 and if you look in your router settings youΓÇÖll see that your router will assign numbers from 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.265 or something close.  YouΓÇÖll want to change your router settings to assign numbers from something like 192.168.1.11 to 192.168.1.265 so you can use the lower numbers (except for ΓÇ£1ΓÇ¥) to assign to your camera(s).  That way you wonΓÇÖt have to worry about future conflicts with your router assigning your camera IP to another device. On your computer, use Windows Key and ΓÇ£RΓÇ¥ (for ΓÇ£RunΓÇ¥), type cmd, then type ipconfig to get your Subnet Mask, Gateway, and DNS server. Change HTTP port to 8090 and any additional camera would be 8091, 8092, etc. Check the box for using wireless LAN and scan for your network; make sure the computer you are on is using the same network or you may have problems (I did and ended up fixing some network inefficiencies when doing troubleshooting on why my cameras kept going in and out).  Complete the network info and security key for the wireless network. I did select UPnP settings after reading a troubleshooting blog. For 8910W, I did disable ΓÇ£go to center on bootΓÇ¥ in PT / PTZ settings so that my camera would not scan the room everytime it booted. For 9821P itΓÇÖs under PTZ/Start-up Options ΓÇô disable startup. After setting up camera and if setting up more than one Foscam camera then do select the other camera(s) in the multi-device section; the software will fill in all the blanks except logon and password ΓÇô youΓÇÖll need to fill those in. I have mounted the Foscam FI8910W on my covered front porch so itΓÇÖs protected from direct element and itΓÇÖs been raining and humid almost non-stop; it is mounted up high and upside down so I had to flip the image in the camera software ΓÇô find the setting just to the left of the video feed.  ItΓÇÖs been there about a month with no problems.  Used a much better mount (sold on Amazon) than what comes with the camera: VideoSecu 1/4&#34; x 20 Threads Swivel Security Camera Mount 2-6 Inch Adjustable Universal Pan Tilt CCTV Camera Mounting Bracket with Ceiling Clip 1BO. Mounted the FI8921P inside using the regular mount ΓÇô it works fine.",5/19/2015

It's now a year later and I can say I am 100% happy with this camera and highly recommend it.  We use it on our iPad with the Foscam Pro application - this application is only a couple $$ and it's worth it.  My mother-in-law is able to log in through her browser as well and watch her grandson sleeping or playing in his room.  The resolution is more than adequate and I always have a clear picture whether it's nighttime or during the day.  The IR functionality works perfect.  I was actually amazed that I could see as good in the dark as I could.  I even went into the room to make sure it was pitch dark.  The ability to pan around the room and have two way audio makes it even better.  Once you have this camera set up you will love it.<br /><br />So the cons.  I'm a techie and the set-up of this camera took quite a bit of research, going through forums, and watching videos.  I have AT&T and at the time there wasn't much documentation on how to set this up for my specific router so I had to go through trial and error.  A year later I'm sure there's better documentation available then there was for me.  You need to know what you're doing as you have to go into the configuration of your router and make modifications.  For viewing your camera away from home use [...] - it's free.  As long as you have the patience to set this camera up or know someone who will set it up for you, it's absolutely worth it.  Remember, Google is your friend.",7/19/2013

Cons: - Not powered directly through ethernet. - BIG PROBLEM: Anytime the cameras sensor is exposed to any light remotely bright (IE; sidewalk on a sunny day) the camera freezes and reboots. This is NOT an isolated problem and has yet to be fixed. Do yourself a favor and find another option for the money.  UPDATE August 22, 2015: I updated the firmware as requested, and the camera still freezes and reboots when the camera sees a bright light. I cannot and will not ever recommend this camera until Foscam decides to do the right thing and recall of these cameras that are affected and replace them free of charge.

But not for the unitiated.","I bought this for my mother so she could keep an eye on her cats while she is on overnight trips.  The setup is definitely not the most user friendly, it involves going into router settings.  If you are getting this for somebody who has only the very basic computer skills, they will most likely have extreme difficulty setting it up.  I was able to set it up for her in about 30 minutes though.  Having only basic understanding of networking/port forwarding, I was able to figure it out with only a little bit of trouble.  Still, this is definitely NOT &#34;plug and play&#34;.<br /><br />Once it is set up, it works pretty well.  It is nice to be able to remotely change the orientation of the camera and to also set it to &#34;auto scan&#34; a room.  However, the frame rate is quite low.  I also attempted to setup the audio capability, but the directions were quite vague and I didn't feel like bothering.<br /><br />So with all of its shortcomings, I still give this a 4 star review because of the price.  There are clearly other camera products that are more user friendly and have better performance, but for $50 I believe this company delivered on my expectations.",7/30/2015

I put my camera in the front door and found the installation, setup, and durability to be amazing. The camera is literally a plug and play kind of camera. I followed the instructions and got my camera to connect to the network within minutes. Then, I fiddled the alert system and the motion detection sensitivity to find the perfect balance for the camera to detect people walking up to the door, but not a random leaf flying through. The great thing about the surveilance is that you can not only broadcast the sound of the environment your camera is in, but also broadcast your voice through the camera. This is quite a useful feature if you want to watch your pet or something that requries your voice. Furthermore, I can set the camera to have certain areas to turn to as a preset and alternate between presets which will make the camera a robotic watchman. This is pretty useful if you have a large area to scan and need constant surveillance.<br /><br />Cons: The one con I have with this camera is that the motion detection, although it works all the time, doesn't have a setting for the camera to record say 30 seconds after detecting motion. Instead, the camera will take about 7 shots and and send them through email to your phone. This is a problem since you are missing certain seconds where people may have done something that you missed. However, it is a problem that isn't that significant. Secondly, the camera cannot change the orientation from portrait to landscape and vice vera. If you want to hang your camera at an angle, you will have to suffer the rath of tilt head syndrome where you can't rotate the video feed so you have to tilt your head to the side in order to watch the video. This is a problem for me since I have my camera basically at an angle so it can see the widest area. The last problem is that the camera will detect motion when the camera switches from night vision to day or vice versa. This is most likely a setting issue, but I found that the motion detection setting that i have that works best has this problem. It isn't that big of a deal since it's just 2 extra emails a day. But, it's still a problem.<br /><br />Verdict: this camera is a great camera for basic surveillance of the house indoor or outdoor. Although if you do do it outdoor, make sure you have a cable that is long enough as well as wifi signal and protection against snow/rain/water. Easy to set up and easy to use. 4/5",1/26/2015

The camera worked perfect closer to the router so after replacing the router I have not had any problems. I am using Blue Iris software instead of the built-in software. I set up all cameras with fixed IP addresses and unique ports, and all are connected to surge protected power sources. Easy setup using the IP Camera tool software that comes with the camera. I have satelite internet and DynDns service to connect remotely to the Blue Iris web server on my computer with excellent results. The audio works good from the camera to the computer and iPhone but have not tried it the other direction. Great price, great features, and reliable so far.

OK for the money for checking in on family, does not perform as advertised 100%, wish it did.",4/16/2015

Hardware build quality is solid. It works when logged into directly from the web browser. However, neither the box nor the website tells you that you must be running a Microsoft Windows PC to completely set this product up. You can remote into the camera from the IP address assigned by the router, but anything after that, to include use of the official Android app, will require a Windows plugin to set up (a happy .exe from FOSCAM's website).<br /><br />There are about ten different FOSCAM apps in the Google Play store, all from different publishers. The Android app linked from FOSCAM's website (blue cloud icon in the Play Store) absolutely WILL NOT connect to the camera, no matter what IP address/port combination you set up. The new app wants you to scan a QR code, which is nowhere to be found on the camera. The new app requires that you to register through the FOSCAM website and download an EXE which works as the intermediary for IP forwarding. There is no way to set this up manually in the new app. Come on. This is 2015. Why are we still requiring Windows to operate?<br /><br />For now, the only solution for remote viewing is to use your web browser (on the computer or phone is okay) and log directly into the webcam.

I read some reviews saying how difficult it was to set up.  Then I saw some youtube videos that made it look not so bad.  I should have heeded the reviews!  This thing does NOT install itself.  I can't get the IP Camera Tool to find the camera IP address when the thing is hooked up to my router.  The instructions are useless, written in broken English in large part.  The tool just shows a blank page, no IP addresses.  The manual says if the IP addresses don't show up automatically, then make sure the DHCP is enabled and MAC address filtering, firewalls and anti-virus are turned off.  What the heck is a DHCP?  How would I know if Mac address filtering is on or off? None of that is explained or discussed. Turning off the firewalls and anti-virus is as far as I know.  Anything else requires an advanced degree in computer tech.  Unless you know what that junk means, steer clear of this turkey.    Step one is to plug it in to the outlet and your router.  Check.  I couldn't make it through step 2, use the IP camera tool.    I bought this camera at a charity silent auction, it had never been used.  Now I know why.  Too bad I wasted my money.  I can't even return this thing.  Dropping it off a tall building is looking like my most attractive option.    Three hours of my life have been pissed away, trying to get this thing to work.  I'll never get that time back, and there are so many productive things I could have done instead.  Supremely frustrated.    Oh yea, only giving it one star because Amazon won't let me give it none.    Additional comments.  After writing above, I texted a friend who has a couple of these.  She told me she had to have her brother who works in IT set it up for her. It was not easy or fast for someone who works in IT. She also suggested looking on the internet for an IP cam viewer.  I found one on CNet and tried it. No go.  I then went looking for others.  After about the 3rd download (I actually think they were all the same program, just different sites offering it), and with the non working IP camera tool still up, I somehow managed to cross proton streams and got an image through the camera.  I was able to pan and see my cats milling around, wondering what I was doing up at 1am. At that point, I copied all the information the camera tool had, that is the missing IP address and all the other techno babble. I then tried to untether the camera from the router and the whole thing crashed.    I spent another 2.5 hours trying to recreate the accident that got the thing to work, and this time I even tried using the camera IP address I had just found.  No go.  I finally gave up at 3:30 in the morning.    The only thing I have to show for all this effort is 3 hours of sleep and I'll be cranky all day at work.    I can't say it enough, while the camera might be OK, the software and rigamarole to set it up sucks big time.  Avoid this thing at all costs.  I'm going to look for a plug and play IP camera from some other manufacturer.",10/30/2014

The cd that comes with it installs a useless tool on Macs that attempts to give you the rest of the info you'll need to proceed with setup, needless to say, other reviews decently cover the process of how to get this baby filming, but I can post my nightmare process if desired.<br /><br />Let me tell you though, the setup is worth it! This bad boy saves me from so many trips into the kiddo's room at night it's not even funny.<br /><br />Usefulness: did I mention how much this has changed my life? Sleep?  Yeah I get that now.

I got one from Amazon and the other directly from Foxcam (they had a sweet one day deal).  I'm pretty savvy with the technical network stuff and had no problems.  I made of couple of simple mistakes along the way during setup, but figured out where I went wrong pretty quickly.  I found the written instructions (read them after I had everything working) were very clear and would be useful to someone without much technical skill.<br /><br />I set my camera up for remote monitoring.  To do so you do need to be ready to log into your home router and make some configuration additions (1) create static IP's and (2) assign port numbers to those IP's.  Remote monitoring works surprisingly well.  I hard wired one camera directly to my router, its too far from the wireless router to get a consisten signal.  The second camera I connected wirelessly.  There are no performance differences.  If you have a good enough wireless signal, that's the way to go.<br /><br />The camera image is clear and the colors seem reasonably accurate.  One camera is mounted inside monitoring the inside, the other under a large eave monitoring the outside.  The eave is big enough that the camera won't get wet.  So far its working fine even though its and inside camera.<br /><br />I did experience the famous buffer overflow / endless reboot problem.  My outside camera is aimed at trees with high detail.  Its the high detail that blows up the camera.  I contacted Foxcam and they now have a software fix.  Foxcam RMA's my camera and within less than two weeks I had the camera back and now it works perfectly.  Problem solved.  I recommend the camera's for simple monitoring.",12/27/2013

It does have some issues with going in and out of NV mode depending on the light conditions and it is a little loud while making the changes.  That said the camera functions good and I have several of them around the house.  I use most of the features and have not experienced any issues with the Black cameras.  I also have one white and it has issues with lighting.  It will reset often and I believe this is due to light penetrating the case as it will constantly switch between NV on/off for a couple of minutes before restarting.  When I put it in a dark environment it works fine.<br /><br />I use one as a baby monitor and the sound pickup is better than any other monitors I have seen.  It sits about 15 feet away from the bed and I can hear my child breathing or any little sound.<br /><br />I would have given it a five star if not for the issue with my white camera.  The web interface is a bit awkward, but once you learn it works well.",3/10/2015

It was a little tricky at first but once I got it up and running through my web browser it was working just ok. Its not as clear as most other cameras I have seen. One problem I encountered when having this camera is that for some reason it tends to switch the URL camera address on me for no reason. I use some other program in order for it to record the front of my house. I have it enabled to record only when it picks up movement. Sometimes you can't even make out a personΓÇÖs face. At the end of the day I would have spent the extra money to get a better quality camera. Also one last thing for some reason this camera always like to disconnect from my network and ill have to refresh it by unplugging then replugging the power then opening it up on my computer. I actually caught a robbery in progress in front of my house and wasnΓÇÖt able to hand in footage to cops because the thing wasnΓÇÖt connected. Don't listen to these other good reviews on here a lot of them are just written because people are supposed to get back some rebate.,6/1/2015

If you just want it as a baby monitor there's no need for Internet access.  If you do set up remote access by all means use cryptic passwords so that outsiders can't sneak inside, virtually speaking.

I called Customer Service the first night and I don't think they have many people working at night because I was on hold for over 45 minutes and was still the 7th person in line.  I figured they might have more staff working during the day and since most people are at work during the day and probably not setting up their cameras, they might have less calls.  I was connected to Albert within 2 mintutes of calling and he set up the wireless connection for both of my cameras and even set up the IP forwarding so that I could access the cameras remotely through an Android app called IP Cam Viewer Basic.  He helped me set up the app as well.  He was so polite and nice on the phone!

Makes me wonder how much of it is a case of user error, rather than hardware issues.  The Web GUI is moderate at best, but once you can work through the kinks and get everything set up, its not that bad.  Too be honest, i've seen a lot worse.  I saw a few reviews saying to avoid using the installation cd that came with the camera but it has some nice features which let you change camera settings without the need for the GUI.  making some setting changes a breeze.  Also, the Foscam Pro app is a MUST HAVE, well worth the 5.99 as it takes the camera's to a whole new level in terms of stability, functionality.<br /><br />The multi-cam set up was a bit flaky in terms of loading all the cameras on to 1 screen but again, most of the issues were because of the web GUI.  The two way audio is nothing crazy but it wasnt high on her priority list.  The pan/tilt feature works great, and has adjustable speed for the rate of motion.  The motion sensor works as described and I've set her up with a second hard drive to store all the recordings.  If you've never set up port forwarding and changed settings on your router, it may be difficult at first.  Seeing as i have done this numerous times, everything worked like a charm.  I recommend use DHCP, but once your router assigns the camera(s) an IP address, make it static so it is linked with that mac address.  so no matter what happens to the camera, when it reconnects, no other device will take its IP address.  Wireless signal seemed fine, but she has a small place with a very open floor plan so i never had any concerns on that being an issue.  The quality was as expected since its only 640x480, having a 720p resolution would have been nice but since the main purpose of the cameras are to be a \\""nanny cam\\"", its fine.  For those who download the app, one feature whichis great, is you can zoom in on the image at the time, and if you choose snap-shot or record it will keep the recording/image on your phone.  So hypothetically if you witness a robbery in progress through your cameras, they can steal your computer but you still have the recording handy on your phone/tablet.<br /><br />I liked the cameras so much that I am actually looking to ditch the cameras that came with my home security system and put these in instead!",7/24/2013

They all worked BUT inconsistently.  What good is having security camera's if you have to reboot them by unplugging them or using the reboot button?  Try to do this while your away from home or on vacation.... so in my opinion (we are an apple family) these are NOT easy to work with.  On top of that- Foscam Customer service is piss poor.  You will NOT get any support from Foscam if you purchase through amazon.  They only support camera's purchased from their site.  I was told by a Foscam Representative that Amazon is an unauthorized seller of Foscam products.  (Go figure that one out)  I repeated this several times to the rep and he repeated it back to me - I even told him that I was going to hang up and call Amazon and basically that was the end of the conversation with Foscam.  Needless to say, I returned all the camera's based on Foscam support PLUS the inconsistency in the camera's reliability staying connected.  There has to be a newer upcoming company that can produce a better camera at a decent price point without comparing themselves to Foscam. ----<br /><br />UPDATE; I discovered on the apple site that they offer a camera called &quot;Canary&quot;- so I purchased one to try out....wow! what a difference. has everything build right in including a siren that you can activate remotely if necessary.

I am now aware how inferior my tech knowledge is after trying to make these cameras work for a few hours last night.<br /><br />Here is a rundown of the basics.<br /><br />2x FOSCAM FI8910W cameras<br />Verizon FIOS home internet, wireless<br />Mac OSX Mavericks<br />iOS7 - iPhones and iPads<br /><br />I purchased the cameras via Amazon.com from Warehouse Deals, Inc. and they were listed as refurbished (so used but back to new). One of the cameras did not come with any instructions or the software CD - bad customer service on the part of Warehouse Deals, Inc?<br /><br />Last night we tried to set up the camera using the iPhone app. That did not work so we plugged the cameras into the router and tried to connect that way. We both have new mac laptops so we no longer have a CD Drive in our house so we could not run the software from the CD included in the camera boxes. I tried downloaded the IP Camera software from the FOSCAM site and it was able to pick up the &#34;Anonymous&#34; camera on the network and take me to the IP page to start ActiveX. Once I clicked on ActiveX, though, I could never get the &#34;Device Management&#34; portion to work (I would click on it and nothing would happen; &#34;Javascript:administrator()&#34; would appear in the lower left of the browser window. I used Chrome, Firefox, and Safari and had the same results for all three. Cookies are enabled in all of the browsers. Internet Explorer is no longer supported by Apple so that is not an option for us.<br /><br />After these tries, we went back to the iPhone app. The app would sporadically 'find' the camera but settings could never be updated. It would drop the camera then find it again. And we would get an error notification that the user name and password were not correct OR we exceeded the number of devices on our network. We checked the devices on our network and that was not the problem.<br /><br />We gave up in frustration at 1am last night having made NO progress or having any luck at all in making the cameras work. The cameras would cycle through its motions but we never got a picture from it in any way.<br /><br />This morning we discovered through the iPhone app that each camera has an odd user name that we did not set up. Now we are curious if this means that our refurbished items were never restored to factory default and we don't have the old user name/password so we can't login because of that...?<br /><br />For the price and capabilities, we want to keep these cameras and get them set up...I just need some help from the interwebs to step me through the process like I've never touched a computer before.<br /><br />Thanks!",1/6/2014

The camera itself seems pretty solid, but because of current and past issues with the Web UI (e.g., the ability to bypass authentication in previous versions), I recommend not making your camera publicly accessible (i.e., don't use port forwarding on your router to allow direct access from the Internet).  I personally use the SSH tunneling feature of JuiceSSH on my Android device to connect to it.

The pan/scan capability is smooth and excellent.<br /><br />It took me just shy of 2 hours to get everything 100% setup, config over wire first then connect to protected WIFI, setup static IP with non-80 port, forwarded port in the router, setup DDNS, install and setup iPhone app to connect from outside the firewall, setup/test alarm schedule plus email notifications and image upload.<br />It's got a great menu... whatever you want to setup, it's in there.  Whatever information you want, including logs of each time the unit noticed a sound, it's there too.<br /><br />If I had one wish for this cam, it would be a higher image resolution (as in 1080p).

But, there have been some issues...<br />Pros:<br />1. Video quality is great for surveillance; don't be expecting to record and HD movie<br />2. The night vision works great and reaches to the end of my driveway and into the street a little<br />3. Set up was super easy and it is very customizable<br />4. Pan and tilt functions work flawlessly<br />5. Wireless connectivity is an added bonus<br /><br />First of all, I know that this is and indoor camera, but I have kept it outside for over 7 months with now issues. To protect it from the elements I mounted underneath the eve of my house so that no rain can get to it. It has survived the winter (dropping well below 15 degrees) and the summer. I started out having the camera connect to my network wirelessly because it was convenient, but I the quality of the video suffered a little bit. I then hard-wired it to my router and then the quality was perfect! I've only had two issues. First, the wireless module stopped working (It would not find any networks). It may be because I had it outside and the cold messed up the wireless module, but I already had it hardwired so it didn't matter to me. The only other issue that I have is the FPS (Frames Per Second). I use a program called ISpy to record my camera. I started noticing that the FPS was very low with this program (It was 4 FPS). I asked Foscam support about it and they said it has something to do with the way they program their cameras. They said they would eventually have a fix for it, but nothing yet. I managed to get the FPS up to 15-16 on the ISpy program and that is satisfactory for me!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Low FPS with some 3rd party programs<br />2. Wireless connectivity",4/7/2014

Camera worked fine for about 5 months, with automatic alerts and remote access through the provided DDNS that came with the camera. Then suddenly, the DDNS shut down. I can't access it from anywhere. Tried contacting customer support, they said it must be the camera. I pinged the DDNS about a dozen times, no response, it's down. Not a single person in support was willing to look into the status of the DDNS which tells me that Foscam must be shutting these down to save money or push for paid tech support. I let them remote access my computer to try to fix it and they came up with nothing. The real kicker is that once customer support failed (because they wouldn't just fix the DDNS) I tried to set up port forwarding and just access it through my IP, still nothing. Whatever they did to my camera, nothing works now. The camera is essentially useless. No email updates, no remote viewing, it's just a lump of hardware sitting on my ceiling unless I feel like forking out $50 for a DDNS that was supposed to be included for the life of the camera, and now I'm not even sure that will work with whatever support did to its innards. 2 stars because the hardware is great, but it's a piece of junk as far as included online access features, which is the whole reason I bought it.",4/13/2015

He uses his iphone and ipad to check in on them.  I thought this was a genius idea, so I bought one to try out.

He was able to walk me through the rest of the process.  This camera is pretty sweet.  The smartphone app lets you control (pan/tilt) the camera, turn the infrared lights on/off and even listen and speak through a two-way microphone.

Once you set them up and can see what you need to see, you will find they become a part of your life like the doors or windows.

The monitor seriously feels like one of the windows. But instead of having to go to the window, move the curtains, and then look out, I just glance at the monitor. It is impossible to describe how life changing it is to be able to see what is going on outside of the house without having to look out a window or go outside.<br /><br />The neighbor's cats are always crawling around outside. If I hear a noise I can just look at the monitor to see if it is them or a person instead of having to go outside. Racoons are also always making a racket I always had to check on. Now I sit and watch them on the monitor while they snoop around.<br /><br />The cameras are a fantastic help with the delivery guys. Since I put one up on the doorway all of my packages are laid very carefully on the steps instead of being hurled up there like they used to be. The delivery guys are always polite and smiling when they see the camera looking at them.<br /><br /> I even ended up putting a monitor in every room to watch them. If I am cooking I can see who is at the door or out front. If I am in bed I can see what is going on. If I am in the dining room or living room I don't have to move a muscle to see who is knocking.<br /><br />I would not install them in the interior of a house though. The hacking threat is too great.<br /><br />You will find a million and one uses for these cameras and you will never be able to stop watching them once they are installed.",8/14/2013

I liked the idea that it has 2-way audio available, could be remotely aimed and being wireless might be an easy install.<br /><br />Setup was fairly easy and I found it worked on Windows, Android, and Apple products with suitable apps.  The integrated IR LEDs are bright enough to illuminate maybe 50-75' out from the camera when its dark.<br /><br />I pretty quickly decided that this should probably not be used outdoors unless extremely well protected from the elements so I ordered a Foscam dome enclosure for it.  One of the first problems I encountered when going into the dome with this is the IR LEDS light up the inside of the dome and wash out the field of view completely when they are on.  So I put black electrical tape over them, not wanting to do any mods like disabling them that might void the warranty.  I then needed an external IR illuminator and assumed that because I can see a small amount of visible red from the installed LEDs they were probably 850nm.  However I didnt want to buy anything until I could conform that 850 was the right choice and ther seemed to be some disagreement on forums about what was best.  So I bought a small sample of clear encased T 1/3/4 &#34;100ma&#34; 850nm, 890nm and 950nm IR LEDS, all rated at about the same luminosity on axis at 100ma and with roughly the same directional characteristics.  I set up a test board with one of each mounted and biased each to operate at the same luminous output as the others based on the published current versus luminosity.  I was easily able to see thru the camera that the 850nm was the best choice as it produced about twice the brightness of the 890 and that twice the 950 with this camera when it was in &#34;IR On&#34; mode. It was dark otherwise.  Side note - the 850 LED doesproduce a slight visible red glow where the 890 and 950 do not.  This is not a mystery, its just a characteristic of LEDs. They produce a primary wavelength light and bell shaped sidebands of longer and shorter and longer wavelength light.  It happens the only output we can actually see from any of these is the red which is on the shorter wavelength sideband of the 850 LED.  I bought an inexpensive 850nm illuminator to mount outside the dome and that works great.<br /><br />Now to my main criticism and the main reason I decided to not install this for my mother to use at her house.  The wireless connection (802.11 G)  is just too slow making the operation of the camera pan and tilt very hit and miss.  Sometimes its immediate and sometimes its....never.  And it is usually somewhere in between.  Maybe 802.11  would be fact enough.  A wired LAN connection is much better, but whats the point in the extra costs of the built-in wifi if you have to wire it up. Anyway I just couldnt see my mother bothering to deal with that.<br /><br />Another weak spot is the sound from the internal speaker or an external speaker/amp plugged in to the camera.  I would guess that a lot gets dropped somewhere between the mic on the smartphone/tablet/desktop (I tried all and, with Android 4.2, Win8, and IOS) and the speaker (its likely at the camera) because it is mostly not understandable.  The other way - mic on the camera to all the above is much better, at least its intelligible.<br /><br />So, I am hanging onto this unit and mounted at my front door in the dome. As it happens getting AC power there is easy but running a LAN cable nearly impossible.  My mother in going to get a fixed mount, no sound POE wired camera - at her house running a LAN is easy, getting AC power to it not so easy.",11/22/2013

Out of the box the camera was doomed to fail. Plugging the camera into the router the camera flashed red and not green like the instructions say. Followed the instructions and ensured that the firewall, MAC filter and anti-virus were all disabled. Attempted to do several hard resets to the camera with no avail.<br /><br />After an hour of debugging, I was able to get the camera to change from a flashing red light to a solid red light. Was able to attach it to my network but for only a few seconds. The camera never readjusted nor re-aligned as it described in the instructions. The network connection would only flicker as it wasn't able to fully connect to my router. I completely reset router settings - twice hoping to clear out any settings that I may have changed.<br /><br />I contacted the Foscam customer service and that was experience was similar to asking a 5 year old questions about Alegbra!

I'm just a regular guy who wanted to install a wifi camera for my kitchen and playroom area. Here is how I see it. Foscam is very defensive right now because of a lot of bad reviews and accusations of some falsies (reviews). There are trying really hard to get it right--based strictly on my experience. I agree with the previous customers that connecting with the included cat 5 cable is the quickest way to get an IP address and \\""get it working.\\"" I was then able to follow the manual directions and get a wireless connection.  The big pain in the process is port forwarding--I wouldn't even bother trying--just call them and they will remote in to your computer, change some router settings and then a pin hole will be created to allow your camera to be viewed by any device and any computer in the world. It took me 10 minutes to get this done from opening the box to hanging up the phone.  Note: they will encourage you to buy the Foscam App for iPhone ($5.99) while on the support line and will help you configure it--while I didn't really want to spend the $5.99, I rationalized I had a tech support guy set me up for free--glad I did it.

Everything, literally everything, about this camera works wonderfully except the software. Virtually no software I could find, be it the iOS app provided from Foscam itself, or even a number of paid 3rd-party iOS apps that work with this camera and others from the App Store will play uninterrupted streaming video from the camera for very long. As others have reported on various internet forums, the video and audio steam starts up fine but after a period of time, the stream dies, and ends up leaving whatever app is playing it in a locked up state. This translates into having to manually reset/reload the video streaming app from your device every 10-15 minutes depending on when it decides to die out.<br /><br />It sounds like this problem is actually with the firmware software that streams video from the camera itself so if that is true, if they would update it and solve the issues, then this review could easily be 5-stars. Until then, I've returned my camera and have gone with a much more expensive Dropcam, which while it does all the same things that this camera does for a LOT more money, at least I can watch the video stream infinitely without having to notice the app needs to be restarted manually.",3/20/2015

I bought the camera, set everything up exactly like the instructions stated. I was then only able to view the camera from my phone twice before it wouldn't connect. So I reset everything back to factory settings and doing every step carefully making sure I didn't mess anything up. Once again it would only work remotely once or twice. After a few days I got frustrated cause I couldn't view my puppy at home while being at work. So i returned it to Amazon and got my money back. Definitely won't be buying this brand again.

I have very limited experience with surveillance cameras, I operate a small restaurant and have tested a Dropcam (which works very well) and now this Foscam. My goal is to eventually have a nine or ten camera system for monitoring staff and customer activity and for security.<br /><br />Product: Camera works very well but does not have built-in recording capability. Foscam provides software that enables you to use your own dedicated PC to record. Foscam's product description doesn't mention that you need a PC for this.<br /><br />Customer support: During install I was able to get all the way to the final step of turning up the camera from my laptop, thus my call for support. The rep with a Fillipino accent told me his name is 'Irish' but later admitted it was a fake name. The phone connection was poor, he was on a wireless phone, and it seemed like a difficult language barrier so I didn't mind when he suggested I allow him to remotely access my computer although looking back now I feel like it was his goal to act confused in order to gain access. 'Irish' turned up the camera so quickly I barely followed and he didn't try to explain the process. When I asked how to record he quickly suggested that I should open my email, which I did but with discomfort that he was remotely attached while I entered my username and password. The end result was that he showed me how the system could send snapshots to my email, which was not really a solution to my need for recording and I started to wonder what was really going on here. I decided to end the call but then he insisted that I open my Amazon account while he was still attached and he insisted I write a review right then. I told him I preferred to write a review after some time to use the product but he started offering me discounts to purchase additional equipment in exchange for a favorable review, so I went along with it at that moment. He ended the call very shortly after he got his review and didn't even bother to make sure I had the correct info to restart the camera on my own. Fortunately I was able to figure that out because I wasn't about to call back. After realizing I had just let a stranger on the phone remotely access my computer and watch me log on to email and my Amazon account I went back into both accounts and changed my passwords. This was a lesson for me. If in the future I have problems with this camera I will use email and online support and not let them log on to my computer again.<br /><br />Update 8-30-13  I've looked into options for continuous recording and realize that this is not the product for me even though they list recording as a feature of this camera. I plan to return the camera.",8/29/2013

My fears came true as it took a long time to get this thing working to my needs. You should be able to get video streaming in 5 mins, but its the other things (email alerts, alarms, motion detection, video recording etc) that are really bad design.I will start with the cons and then mention the pro<br />Cons:<br />Really terrible user interface<br />The software that comes with it, the active x controls that you need to enable to use. The fact that in order to have full functional editing you can only use internet explorer. Firefox and Chrome just outright dont show some of the basic options.<br />Did I say the UI is terrible. Let me qualify it has nothing to do with the aesthetics. Pure functionality is so unreliable. You will have to browse through forums and quick google searches to get the fixes from other users.<br />Downloaded the latest firm ware but it does not help with the UI issues a bit.<br />Alot of good options are listed in configuration and device management but there is no simple or intuitive way of enabling them.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Video Quality (640x480) is decent and flows decently on wifi. (bare minimum expectation since that is what the product is supposed to be)<br />Night vision is excellent.<br />Range is decent on a G router.<br />So far no failure noted on camera rebooting (as some users have reported)<br /><br />Overall, I am very disappointed given that no effort has been spent for a professional or at least predictably working software. The hardware seems fine, the camera rotates and all remotely. If you ok paying the money purely for the hardware and willing to spend time figuring out the hacks to get the most functionality out of the product, than go for it.<br />Otherwise I would recommend trying something else.",8/5/2015

Particularly port forwarding.<br /><br />I got on their web-site and they have pretty helpful videos on setting it up. My only complaint with the videos is they tend to wander off the main point with a lot of \\""...oh by the way...\\"" sort of comments.<br /><br />Bottom line is I had this setup and running, complete with port forwarding in about 45 minutes or so. I'm not a geek and it wasn't that hard to do. Just preview the videos and follow the written setup instructions.<br /><br />I find the e-mail alerts to be the real security value. This was the most tedious portion of the setup as i had to dig around in my e-mail app to get the setting my ISP needs to get an e-mail sent.<br /><br />I'm using Wi-FI in an area that is about 20' from the Wi-FI router so I can't comment on reviews that stated the WI-FI is not so good.<br /><br />I like the motion detected alerts but I found the sound alerts to be way too much for the location we have it setup. If our dogs barked or a door slammed you get an e-mail. It is easy to engage or disengage the alerts.<br /><br />Overall, I couldn't be happier with this purchase.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Today, Dec. 30th, the camera seemed to be defective. It lost it's motion alert e-mail feed, repositioned it's camera FOV and just seemed to have failed.<br /><br />I got e-mails from it that showed it's internet IP address but I couldn't connect on my iMac using either the local IP or the internet IP address.<br /><br />On the iPhone I was trying to connect via the internet IP and it was NG as well.<br /><br />As a test, I jumped on my work WIN 7 laptop and tried to connect using the internet Ip address.

This camera has night vision, which is great if you want to monitor with no light, and it actually does excellent! I put the camera inside a window looking out, and when the infrared comes on at night it reflects on the window and blinds the camera. Since I have plenty of light at night I've been turning off the infrared manually every night, because I haven't found a way to turn it off permanently. I'm not too concerned about it because I will eventually move it outside (not exposed to the elements, but not behind glass). The quality of the video is better that I was expecting from a camera that's wireless, with night vision, pan and tilt, e-mail notifications, motion detection at such low price. I was hesitant to buy it, but I'm glad a took a chance.<br /><br />I have to admit that the setup is a bit challenging for someone who is not familiar with how routers work and how to achieve port forwarding, and networking in general. I didn't have to call for tech support, but the videos on the foscam.us website really helped me grasp the concept of the setup. I started watching the videos before I even received the camera, so when I got it in the mail I had a basic understanding of what I needed to do.<br /><br />I just wanted to add one more thing: my internet provider issued me a modem/wireless router combo, but since I have a nice router that I wanted to use, they disabled the wireless router part of their modem, so I had issues with port forwarding: I opened the ports in my router, but canyouseeme.org kept saying it was still blocked. I called my provider to ask them if they blocked that port on their side, and he proceeded to tell me that they didn't but the modem/router combination did, so I would have to either open the port on both THEIR router and MY route, or go to their local office and swap it for a regular modem. I opted of the stand alone modem and once I did the ports were opened and everything worked great.<br /><br />If you're thinking about getting this camera, please take the time to watch the setup videos on the foscam website and do not rush through the setup, otherwise you will get frustrated with it!",7/17/2014

I've had my foscam for about a week now and it's a terrible product.  I specifically purchased it to take pictures of movement to monitor my house.  All the pictures are nearly delayed and miss the action.  The pictures show a late image of a person then all the remaining pictures are blank.  It's almost as though the timing for the photo is off or late.  Either way, this product is not worth ALL the time, effort and money I've spent on it.  Furthermore, it was complicated to set-up and I continually had to reset the camera to \\""factory settings\\"" while trying to connect the wireless feed.  VERY FRUSTRATING.  DO NOT purchase this product, spend a little more money and get better quality.  Trust me it's worth the peace of mind and sanity.  I'm returning it Monday.  Good luck. jmm",10/27/2013

Cheaper than the name brand products.<br />2. Good picture quality during the day or at night.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. No proper item details and specifications. The extension is around 8 feet and it includes a wall/stand mount so don't by accessories as suggested by Amazon or user comments which are ill advised and wrong.<br />2. Firmware is not up to date.  The upgrade is not easy for a non-techy person.<br />3. Provided software doesn't work well.  Can't monitor externally even though I have good bandwidth.  IP locator crashes.<br />4. Incompatible with external monitoring software.  In all fairness most of the issues could be with them.<br />5. Black color is cheaper but uglier (I should blame myself)<br />6.

This was the infuriating part which almost made me return it. I wish I had the guide that I found online that helped me fix this but make sure you pay VERY close attention to that  serial number on the bottom of the camera-not just the model number.<br /><br />On to the camera, the picture is grainy and passable quality which is fine for what I and I figure many would use this device for. You can tell what people are doing and has enough detail to make out what is going on. One thing that bothers me is the refresh rate says it's 60hz but it's clearly running 30 or less FPS. While I don't need 60fps, seeing that refresh rate and the actual rate the wireless is delivering feels a bit like a lie to me.<br /><br />All and all the camera works well, you can easily pan it to look around and use the mic to hear if there's anything going on/anyone hurt.

However, I did spend a huge amount of time trying to connect the wireless system. I called Foscam tech support and they were helpful, but nobody could figure out the wireless router access problem. As a last resort I decided to try a new router or router extender. I purchased a Foscam model FR305 wireless router for $29 hooked it up directly to my Actiontech 1000 router and both of my cameras hooked up perfectly with no more problems. I would highly advise anyone who buys a Foscam camera to spend the extra $29 dollars and buy the Foscam router, it will save you a huge amount of time and headache.",8/15/2014

It's not easy to make out faces for example, which seems essential to me. If you know who the person is already, you could tell it's their face. If a stranger were to appear on the video then it'd be hard to exactly identify them from what you have.  - The motion detection is primitive. It seems either too sensitive or not sensitive enough. Something like switching lights on/off will set off motion detection, despite an option available which claims to reduce false positives from light changes. Expect at least a week of tweaking the sensitivity options. Even the IR lights turning on/off will trigger the motion detection.    Works fine, and good enough for a entry level security camera for home.",11/25/2014
